You thought of it all the time Knew it would catch you some day It would get you
And now there is no place to run to

<strong>Now it is here</strong><strong>It has caught you</strong><strong>Killed
all your feelings</strong><strong>Destroyed the warm
silence</strong><strong>Blew out the candle</strong><strong>It has caught
you</strong><strong>ItÂ´s so damn bad</strong><strong>Now there is no place to
run to</strong><strong>It has caught you</strong>

There once was a doll called Liza She was so damn sweet The sweetest of all You
loved her Loved her madly The long curly hair The porcellain skin

Her big blue eyes You loved her madly And now she is broken Fallen from her
table Broken into pieces Lying on the cold hard floor

<strong>Now it is here</strong><strong>It has caught you</strong><strong>Killed
all your feelings</strong><strong>Destroyed the warm silence Blew out the candle
</strong><strong>It has caught you </strong><strong>It is so damn bad
</strong><strong>Now there is no place to run to </strong><strong>It has caught
you</strong>

And you will never see Liza again
