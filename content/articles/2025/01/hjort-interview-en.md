**"Evolve IV–VIII" is an album that is truly special to multi-instrumentalist Johannes Lenk. Fresh off the press, it captivates with gripping arrangements full of symphonic harmony, experimental sounds, and nearly impenetrable walls of guitar. I had the privilege of getting to know the artist behind the music, and today, I'm excited to share my interview with you.**

If you've always been fascinated by the interplay of darkness and heaviness with softness and light, you don't want to miss "Evolve IV–VIII". Fans of post-rock and similar genres are in for a treat, with a perfect balance of weight and lightness wrapped in a highly creative and progressive masterpiece that truly enchants.

This is an album to listen to repeatedly—whether in moments of quiet reflection or those filled with restlessness, upheaval, and new beginnings. The tracks on "Evolve IV–VIII" are as intense, moving, and crystal-clear as the winter wind that served as one of Johannes's inspirations while writing them—but more on that in the interview.

**Note:** My conversation with Johannes took place on January 23rd, 2025. His album "Evolve IV-VIII" was released on January 24th.

**Anne:** Hi! Thanks for making the time! Your incredible album, "Evolve IV–VIII," is coming out soon. Are you excited?

**Johannes:** Hi Anne! First off, thank you so much for the compliment—it's great to hear you like the album. And yes, I'm absolutely buzzing for the release. Even though I've been through quite a few releases with various bands and projects over the years, the anticipation leading up to release day never really changes. It's a mix of joy, pride, relief, and nerves—since you're essentially putting something deeply personal out there for everyone to see and critique. But that's also what makes it exciting. For me, the audience's reception and feedback are what truly complete a piece of art.

**Anne:** What have you planned for release day?

**Johannes:** Sit back and enjoy! No, seriously, there's not much you can do at that point. But I've got a little ritual: I'll make myself a nice drink, dim the lights, and listen to the record in full on Friday for the first time in ages. It's my way of marking the occasion.

**Anne:** What inspired these five remarkable tracks? There's talk of winter winds in frosty woodland…

## "The colder months inspire me"

![Johannes Lenk, Hjort](https://storage.googleapis.com/cardamonchai-media/2025-01-27/hjort-interview-soundsvegan-com-3-jpg-imagine-080808_6a6a6a_1024_768/640.webp 'Johannes Lenk, Hjort')

**Johannes:** Oh, is that what they're saying? Sounds a bit cliché, doesn't it? But honestly, I do tend to write this kind of music in autumn or winter. The cold, mist, darkness, and calm of snow-covered landscapes all seem to stick in my mind while I write.

**Anne:** You're based in Mannheim. How would you describe the music scene there? Is it as inspiring as a winter forest?

**Johannes:** Mannheim, with its industrial charm, has a fascinating scene. I'm a "newcomer"—I've only been here 20 years—and I love it. Back when I arrived, there wasn't just the well-known Pop Academy, but also a lively and tight-knit underground metal scene. It felt like everyone was collaborating in some way, playing gigs together, and organising an annual local festival. Over time, things naturally shifted, but the connections are still there. While I wouldn't call Mannheim a "metal city," it punches above its weight with a surprising number of talented and even internationally recognised musicians and bands. It's the kind of environment where you push each other to do better.

**Anne:** What's the story behind Hjort?

**Johannes:** Hjort is my solo project, and I do absolutely everything myself—apart from the mastering. What "everything" entails, I'll leave it for listeners to discover.

## Hjort's music is shaped by a longing for nature—and the fear of losing it

**Anne:** How have your experiences with V/Haze Miasma influenced these stunning arrangements?

**Johannes:** They're definitely connected. I also write most of the music for V/Haze Miasma, and I approach both projects with a similar vibe. Both are inspired by a longing for nature and the fear of losing it bit by bit. But V/Haze Miasma dives more into contrasts—exploring darker themes and human or personal struggles. With Hjort, the purely instrumental approach allows me to set those themes aside.

**Anne:** What's changed since your debut, "Trilogie I–III" in 2022?

**Johannes:** Quite a bit, actually. Hjort started in 2022 as a spontaneous project, fuelled by an excess of inspiration. Back then, I didn't have big ambitions—I just released each track as soon as it was finished, entirely on my own. The songs were intentionally dark, monotone, and experimental. With "Evolve IV–VIII," I wanted to write a full album and open myself up to melodies and clearer song structures. A lucky twist of fate led to working with Inertial Music, which has been fantastic. Thanks to them, I can release on vinyl and have opportunities like this interview.

**Anne:** Do you think our increasingly harsh world affects how you create music?

## Hjort is my musical retreat

![Johannes Lenk, Hjort](https://storage.googleapis.com/cardamonchai-media/2025-01-27/hjort-interview-soundsvegan-com-2-jpg-imagine-989898_7e7d7a_1024_768/640.webp 'Johannes Lenk, Hjort')

**Johannes:** For V/Haze Miasma, I'd say absolutely. That project reflects feelings like humility, melancholy, despair—and even anger and aggression. On the other hand, Hjort is my retreat from all that, much like nature itself is for me.

**Anne:** "Metal and meditation"—I love that quote from you. I think the blend of those extremes is what makes Hjort so unique. Is that fair to say?

**Johannes:** It's not entirely a joke when I say I started Hjort because I wanted good music for yoga, haha! But yes, much like with V/Haze Miasma (though without the expressive impact of vocals or screams), it's about balancing loud and quiet, harsh and beautiful, dark and light. I'm drawn to that dynamic, and it keeps pulling me back.

**Anne:** Some music is just there to listen to—it gets us through the day, gives us comfort. Then there's the kind that inspires us, the albums and bands that stick with us for life. Which ones do that for you?

**Johannes:** That's a tough one—there's so much! Off the top of my head, I'd say Soundgarden's "Superunknown", Pain of Salvation's "The Perfect Element", Portishead's "Dummy", and Saviour's "Machine's II". But ask me tomorrow, and I'll probably name four others. My tastes are all over the place!

**Anne:** The year's just begun—what's next for you after the release?

**Johannes:** Hjort is a studio project for now, so no gigs are planned. But I'm already itching to work on new Hjort material—it is winter, after all! Plus, there might be something new from V/Haze Miasma soon. And if you know me, you know there are always other musical projects brewing.

**Anne:** Thanks for the interview—it's been such a pleasure! Best of luck with the album! I can't wait to share it with my readers.

**Johannes:** Thanks so much, Anne! I appreciate your interest in Hjort and your asking such thoughtful questions!
