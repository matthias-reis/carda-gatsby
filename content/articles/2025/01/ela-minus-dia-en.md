**Ela Minus's "Dìa" drops on 17 January—and trust me, this one needs a place on your radar. Expect expansive soundscapes and wildly imaginative electronic vibes. Based in New York but deeply connected to her Colombian roots, Ela has already given us a taste of what's to come with her latest single, "Broken," alongside a stunning music video. You can check it out in this article.**

Following her EPs and 2020 debut album, "Acts of Rebellion", Ela Minus has seriously levelled up with "Dìa". You'll absolutely adore her work if you're into quality electronic music. She's crafted a sonic mosaic that's rich in texture, blending a variety of musical influences. The minimalist feel of "Acts of Rebellion" has evolved—on "Dìa", Ela goes all out with a more opulent approach, which suits her like a dream.

This album showcases both her introspective and her bold, outgoing side, proving there's no such thing as a one-dimensional person. We all have a kaleidoscope of facets, and Ela's shine brighter and more vividly than most. The introspective tracks on "Dìa" are just as captivating as the upbeat, high-energy moments—each one offering something to lose yourself in.

Ela spent three transformative years wandering the globe, piecing together fragments of inspiration that now form the stunning mosaic of Dia. Her travels across Colombia, Mexico, North America, and Europe fed directly into her songwriting. She credits places like New York, Seattle, Mexico City, and London with shaping her sound and pushing her to uncover truths she felt compelled to share.

Take, for example, the genesis of Dia's opening track, "Abrir Monta." Late one night, in a remote cabin high in the Mexican mountains, Ela stumbled upon a chord progression that immediately clicked: She knew it had to open the album. The song's lush, resonant tones weave through a backdrop of gentle static and airy sequences, creating a powerful first impression. Ela explains:

> "'Abrir Monta' is a phrase from my home that describes cutting through dense foliage. I've always loved the poetry of that image. That's how creating this album felt—like carving new paths inward and outward, stepping into uncharted territory."

For "Dìa", Ela once again collaborated with Marta Salogni (mixing) and Heba Kadry (mastering), who also contributed to "Acts of Rebellion". Of the ten tracks on the album, songs like "Broken" (track 2), "Upwards" (track 9), and "Combat" (track 10) are already available to stream. You can catch Ela Minus live on 14 February at the Max Schmeling Halle in Berlin, supporting Caribou.
