**An Evening With Knives are about to smash out their third album, "End of Time", and it's a must-listen. The band takes on the chaos of our times, both politically and socially, and the result? Heavier, darker, and more intricate than ever. Here is my preview!**

Fueled by fresh energy and raw intensity, An Evening With Knives are back with a serious punch. Joining the band lineup for "End of Time" is drummer Jarno van Osch, completing a sound that's heavier than a ton of bricks. The album delivers crushing riffs, trippy psychedelic moments, and lyrics that hit deep—emotional, personal, and straight from the gut. It's raw, unfiltered, but somehow still polished to perfection.

All in all, "End of Time" is the soundtrack to 2025's madness – powerful, unapologetic, and impossible to ignore. You need this in your collection if you're into music that leaves a mark. No excuses.

"End of Time" will drop on March 1st, 2025, via Electric Spark Records (Vinyl) and Argonauta Records (CD). Eindhoven is getting a proper release party to celebrate, and in the meantime, you can already check out the first single, "Voices". Link's below—you know what to do.
