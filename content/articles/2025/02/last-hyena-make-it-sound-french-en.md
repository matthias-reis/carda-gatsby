**I think I fell in love with Last Hyena's music at ArcTanGent—no turning back after that. Now, the Bristol trio is back with a fresh single. With Make It Sound French, the band dives into those unexpected, overwhelming moments life throws at you.**

They recorded, mixed, and mastered Make It Sound French with Mark Roberts (Delta Sleep, Black Peaks, Poly-Math, Jamie Lenman) at Middle Farm Studios in Devon. The track weaves elements of math-rock, post-rock, and ambient noise.

When asked what they wanted to express with the song, the members of Last Hyena said:

> "With 'Make It Sound French', we wanted to explore the emotional weight of complex situations purely through music. It's a deeply personal piece for us, with the absence of words inviting a more universal experience where the music speaks directly to the emotions we all go through. The track builds from intricate guitar textures, driving rhythms to moments of cathartic release, using dynamic shifts and thoughtful builds to express the tension between disorder and serenity, aiming to create a sonic representation of the process of working through inner chaos and ultimately finding clarity."

Talking about the track's title, the band adds:

> "The title comes from a story shared by a close friend whose father was in a punk band in his younger years. During one of their shows, the band decided to play an impromptu cover of 'Ça plane pour moi' by Plastic Bertrand. When the lead singer, our friend's father, told his bandmates he didn't know the lyrics, one of them responded with, "Just make it sound French!". This spontaneous moment stuck with us because it perfectly embodies the themes we wanted to explore in the track: Adapting to the unexpected, leaning into the chaos and finding a way to make something work even when things aren't perfect. The title captures that spirit of improvisation and fluidity, much like the journey the music takes listeners on. We're thrilled to share this journey with our listeners, and we hope it resonates with anyone who's ever had to find peace in the midst of turmoil."

Last Hyena formed back in 2016. Ever since, their song writing sessions have been all about exploring math-rock rhythms, post-rock soundscapes, and punchy riffs. Time and time again, they craft unforgettable tracks that push boundaries and make for mind-blowing live shows.

Make It Sound French follows the band's 2021 debut album, How Soon is Mars?, which received glowing reviews. Last Hyena took it to the stage at the UK's iconic ArcTanGent Festival among other festivals and venues.
