Following his releases on companies like Dekmantel, Rush Hour, Further Records, Source Records, Minimal Detroit Audio, and Rawax he’s now with quiet details sharing his skills with combining musical styles, his virtuous way of handling synths and playing with layers with the fans of the UK-based label.

When listening to "Hope isn't a Four Letter Word" you can sense his influences from all niches known in music—from free jazz to classic Chicago House and Detroit Warehouse techno and drum’n’base to psychedelic experimental sounds. With his masterful way of bringing all these genres together, he touches the hearts of everyone listening to his tunes.

## A flight through time and space

While spinning the record you set up on a flight through time, space, centuries and parallel worlds—bringing back hope by revealing how perfectly all those different styles and elements fit together, and how beautiful change and diversity is. Reminding us about not to give up hope about in the end, understanding, equality and empathy will take over, leading us to a kinder world at some point.

Harmony, stirring melodies, and mesmerising song structures: "Hope isn't a Four Letter Word" has it all. With the first chord, you enter a world full of beautiful and well-merged digital textures, electronic elements, analogue synths, melodica and Rhodes Piano sounds. Jordan GCZ is waking up our hope by gifting us nine brilliant songs that couldn’t be more driving, calming, melodic and percussive—all at once and always on point and in the right moment. Reminding us, life is not always as light, but it can become easier again, if we’re not giving up hope and believe in the power of change, miscellaneousness, and empathy.

Listen to this album and have a look at the custom six-panel digipak physical edition. It. comes with a separate beautiful fine art print.
