**Listen up—"Espace temps" is a proper atmospheric journey through time and space. Michael Pike, an ambient maestro straight outta Nice, takes us on a cosmic ride with his latest album. Packing six tracks full of lush, otherworldly soundscapes, this one's a top pick for anyone who loves to kick back and get lost in sound.**

The opening track, "Espace temps", sets the tone straight away with floaty synth waves, vibing in a dreamy, meditative haze. Michael's got a knack for crafting deep, cinematic soundworlds, and from the get-go, you know you're in for something unique.

## Soundscapes & Vibes

![Michael Pike "Espace temps"](https://storage.googleapis.com/cardamonchai-media/2025-02-21/michael-pike-espace-temps-soundsvegan-com-album-artwork-jpg-imagine-080848_070155_700_700/640.webp 'Michael Pike "Espace temps"')

With "La nuit du sphinx", the album dives deeper into a mysterious, slightly dystopian atmosphere. The smooth yet punchy electronic elements nod to legends like Brian Eno and Tangerine Dream—proper pioneer vibes.

## The Standout Track

If there's one track that really hits differently, it's "Point Némo". Named after the most isolated spot in the Pacific, this one nails the feeling of solitude and infinite vastness. Subtle tonal shifts shimmer like distant light on open water – pure magic.

Another stunner is "La chevelure de Bérénice", inspired by the "Berenice's hair" stellar constellation. Minimalist, almost classical ambient tones blend with cosmic melancholy—think Vangelis, yeah? Proper vintage sci-fi soundtrack vibes.

Then there's "La danse des lucioles", where Michael, who used to work for a Paris radio station, mixes quick, flickering sounds for a playful twist in the otherwise hypnotic flow. And finally, the big closer: Dream about Saturn's rings. This one floats in with soaring, orchestral-style layers, bringing a lush, weightless finish to the whole trip.

## Well Worth a Listen!

All in all, "Espace temps" is a proper dreamy album. It's got that imagination-stirring magic and is perfect for late-night headphone sessions or deep creative focus. If you're into chilled, introspective soundscapes, you're in for a solid sonic journey.
