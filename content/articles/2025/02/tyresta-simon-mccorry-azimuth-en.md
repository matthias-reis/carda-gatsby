**Yesterday, Feb 19th, saw the drop of "Azimuth", the first full-length collab between Tyresta (aka Nick Turner, Chicago) and cellist Simon McCorry (Gloucestershire, UK). This album blends lush, swelling guitar soundscapes with delicate string sections and modular synth flourishes, creating a sonic experience that's both impressionistic and deeply immersive.**

If you're into acoustic chamber vibes, experimental textures, and a sprinkle of shoegaze energy, this one's got your name on it. The five tracks weave seamlessly together, building a dreamy, meditative trip packed with warmth, hope, and a sense of forward motion.

## "Sea Change"

![Tyresta & Simon McCorry "Azimuth"](https://storage.googleapis.com/cardamonchai-media/2025-02-20/tyresta-simon-mccorry-azimuth-album-artwork-soundsvegan-com-jpg-imagine-d8d8b8_9fad84_700_700/640.webp 'Tyresta & Simon McCorry "Azimuth"')

The opener, "Sea Change", sets the tone with dramatic, layered cello waves, gradually unveiling a melody that fully pulls you in. Tyresta's guitar slides in, and together they paint an ever-shifting sonic landscape—rich in colour, slow-burning, and hypnotic.

## "Meridian"

"Meridian" kicks off with distorted drone hums and smooth legato strings. This one builds serious tension, pushing the anticipation to another level and beautifully setting up what's coming next.

## "Azimuth"

The title track takes its name from navigational astronomy, and you can totally hear that sense of searching and direction. It starts off serene and clear, then gradually dissolves into deep drone layers—like the sound of wind roaring through the dunes.

## "Close to the Wind"

Flipping to the B-side, "Close to the Wind" eases in gently before dropping some slick percussive elements and an energetic cello passage. Tyresta sums it up perfectly:

> "When Simon overlays sweeping stacked harmonies with hushed staccato rhythms, you can picture the peace and warmth of a lighthouse cutting through the restless cobalt-blue depths."

Anyone here who could've said it better? I don't think so.

## "Beneath the Waves"

Wind leads to waves—it's just nature, yeah? And Tyresta & Simon keep that flow going as "Beneath the Waves" closes the album. Reverb-soaked plucked guitar meets weighty, atmospheric strings, pulling and pushing like waves rolling onto shore, crashing, retreating, and returning to the deep.

## Tyresta & Simon McCorry

Beyond the music, Tyresta spends his time working in mental health, bringing a deep sense of empathy to his writing. Simon, meanwhile, explores themes of fragility and feeling like an outsider in a world full of stereotypes—a theme he also worked on with his 2021 solo release "And Where Are You Really From?" (Polar Seas Recordings).

Before "Azimuth," the two had already teamed up on tracks for Tyresta's 2023 album "Small Hours" (Past Inside The Present). The idea of an entire album had been floating around for a while, and when they finally made it happen, creativity and friendship fuelled the whole process.

"Azimuth" is out now on Past Inside The Present. You can grab it on Bandcamp (digital or vinyl) or stream it wherever you get your tunes.
