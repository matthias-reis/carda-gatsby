**Beyond Frequencies—the band led by songwriter and vocalist Blazy Flash—have just wrapped up their new album, "Everything I Am". The Swiss musician with Norwegian roots sticks to her vision of carving out her unique sound. Blending pop with metal, she effortlessly breaks down stereotypes on both sides.**

I sat down with her to chat about pop, metalheads, the rush of being on stage, and the new record. Her comeback after a short break in 2023 is something she hasn't regretted for a single second—and honestly, we're lucky to have her back. Welcome back, Blazy Flash!

**Anne:** Hey! Thanks for taking the time to chat! How's it going?

**BF:** Brilliant! We can't wait for the album to drop!

**Anne:** So, your third studio album, "Everything I Am", is all set to release on 20th February. Excited? I'm guessing you've got a lot planned around the release date?

## "We're fine-tuning our new live show"

**BF:** Oh, absolutely! We're buzzing! Right now, we're putting the final touches on our new live show—expect some surprises. Plus, there are a few more videos coming in the next weeks, so yeah, plenty is happening.

**Anne:** Your sound has evolved since your last album—it's got more depth. Was that the natural next step for you?

**BF:** This album is deeply personal. It was shaped by a time when I was dealing with some serious health struggles—which, luckily, I got through. But it completely pulled the rug out from under me. Besides my incredible family, music and songwriting were my lifelines. At times, it felt like the only thing left of me was the music—the songs were literally _everything I am_. You can hear all of that in the album. So, it wasn't some calculated move, it just naturally grew out of what I was going through.

**Anne:** I love your melodic side! I'm so glad you've kept that as part of your sound. Would you say that's a signature element of Beyond Frequencies?

**BF:** 100 per cent! The whole idea behind Beyond Frequencies is to build a bridge between pop and metal—even if saying "pop" around metalheads can raise some eyebrows! But yeah, catchy hooks and strong melodies are a big part of our DNA.

**Anne:** You bring together fans from all kinds of genres, blending metal with pop elements. Do you see yourselves as musical bridge-builders, or do you think these two worlds have always been connected?

## "We love building bridges"

**BF:** Yeah, we're definitely building bridges, but I'd say Beyond Frequencies is more like a gateway drug for people who haven't explored metal yet. And for hardcore metalheads, we bring a feel-good high. Mixing genres has always been a thing—musicians love to experiment. Sometimes metal and pop have been close, sometimes further apart, but they've always been connected in some way.

**Anne:** What inspires you the most when writing songs?

**BF:** Raw, unfiltered life. Human behaviour—and misbehaviour! Our emotions, our individual triggers, the way we react to things… it's a bottomless well of inspiration.

**Anne:** Blazy Flash, before Beyond Frequencies, you made music with Phonoflakes. How did that shape your current sound?

**BF:** Phonoflakes was where I took my first steps—learned the ropes, paid my dues, and got my first taste of the professional music world. We played tons of gigs, which definitely shaped me as a live musician and gave me a solid foundation.

Style-wise, though, it doesn't have a significant influence on Beyond Frequencies. That's more about my overall life experiences. However, collaborating with our producers, Christoph Siemons and Fabian Zimmermann, has a massive impact on our sound. They've left a strong mark on Beyond Frequencies.

**Anne:** You played at the legendary Viper Room with PF. Could you feel the magic of the place, or does every venue feel the same once you're on stage?

## "The Viper Room has a special kind of magic"

**BF:** Honestly, it's probably just another venue… but the feeling was unreal. There was magic in the air. Playing there was special. And what really blew me away was the professionalism of the crew. I've never seen anything like it—not even in Switzerland, where things are super organised.

Everything was on point, every move calculated—nothing left to chance. It was a masterclass in how the entertainment industry runs on a whole different level in LA.

**Anne:** You took a break from music between 2013 and 2020. Did stepping away help you find new focus and inspiration?

**BF:** "Break" is putting it mildly—I straight-up quit music. Thought I'd never come back. But when I finally decided to return, I was laser-focused. That mindset shift has made all the difference. I'm an all-or-nothing kind of person—I either go all in or not at all. So yeah, that time off definitely reignited my creativity.

**Anne:** You started Beyond Frequencies in 2020, right when the world was going crazy. How did that impact the band?

"Finding calm in the chaos"

**BF:** Big time. The faster the world spins, the more we find our inner calm—which is actually a theme in our song "Eye of the Storm" from the album.

**Anne:** You've already dropped 20 music videos. Do you feel music hits harder when paired with visuals?

**BF:** It'll be 24 videos by the album release! The name Beyond Frequencies hints that it's not just about sound waves—the visual side is just as important. Whether through videos or our live show, it's all about the whole artistic experience. So yeah, music definitely hits differently when it's combined with visuals.

**Anne:** Before performing live, you had to wait three years because of the pandemic. Did the videos become a substitute for gigs?

**BF:** Absolutely. Beyond Frequencies was born in 2020, so live shows weren't an option for the first few years. Even now, we're not on stage as much as we'd like. But sitting around doing nothing? Not our thing. So, we channelled our energy into making videos. Once we're touring properly, expect plenty of live footage too. We're all about top-tier entertainment!

**Anne:** When you finally played live again, what was that like?

**BF:** A huge relief. Overwhelming, in the best way. Playing live brings our music to life in a way recordings never can. The energy is just next level.

**Anne:** You toured Europe with Semblant. What stood out the most?

## "With each tour, we want to push it even further"

![Blazy Flash, Beyond Frequencies"](https://storage.googleapis.com/cardamonchai-media/2025-02-13/beyond-frequencies-soundsvegan-com-2-jpg-imagine-f8f8f8_c3c4c6_768_1024/640.webp 'Blazy Flash, Beyond Frequencies')

**BF:** There are so many unforgettable moments, but picking just one is hard. We met incredible fans, old and new, and had memorable experiences.

**Anne:** Anything you'd do differently on your next tour?

**BF:** The best thing about touring is that you can always up your game. Each show gets sharper. We can't wait to hit the road again and push it even further!

**Anne:** The year's just started—what's next for you?

**BF:** We're itching to take our new live show on the road. Plus, we've got two more music videos lined up and a secret ad campaign coming soon. And in autumn, we'll be heading back into the studio for album number four. The storm keeps raging! (laughs)

**Anne:** Thanks for the chat! Wishing you all the best!

## Beyond Frequencies – "Enemy Inside"

Blazy Flash wrote the song "Enemy Inside" about _gaslighting_. Here is her what she says about it:

> "Gaslighting is a form of psychological abuse, in which a very close person who enjoys your deepest trust deliberately shatters your self-perception: through manipulation, distortion of reality, spreading lies and rumors. It destroys the victim's self esteem and can leave them feeling vulnerable and isolated, without realizing who's the real enemy."
