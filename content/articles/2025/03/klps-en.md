**Guys, there is something we need to talk about! The post-metal/sludge project K L P S (KOLLAPS\E) from Helsingborg, Sweden has a new album out on These Hands Melt! The self-titled piece consists of six songs that couldn't be more intense. Just what we were all wishing for!**

If you are looking for music to quietly sit in the background—go search for another album. If not: "K L P S" is made for you! From the first track, "Subverse" you get drawn into this cold, vast and fascinating landscape that doesn't set you free till the last chord on the record fades.

## "The essence of what we are"

![K L P S – "S/T"](https://storage.googleapis.com/cardamonchai-media/2025-03-07/klps-album-artwork-soundsvegan-com-jpg-imagine-787878_737373_1200_1200/640.webp 'K L P S – "S/T"')

K L P S created an atmosphere that couldn't be more heavy. While the six songs keep unfolding and building into each other, you feel like you become part of some kind of ritual—hypnotised and spellbound, always curious about what awaits you behind the next corner of this ghostly and also heavy story.

Here is what K L P S say about their new album:

> "We are thrilled to share this new chapter in our musical journey with our fans and supporters. We believe that S/T captures the essence of who we are as artists, and we can't wait for everyone to experience it."

A dark new chapter, if you ask me—and an incredibly beautiful one!

If you're into bands like Year of No Light, Neurosis and Old Man Gloom, you will love this album. Like in the music of those projects, you won't find any shortcuts on "K L P S". Just listen to it in one go—over and over again. Every time you spin this record again, you'll find new details and hints—every single one of them very well-placed and on point. At the same time, the record is quite straightforward. A chance to have an intense view into the abyss—in a very good way.

### Side note:

In case you were wondering why K L P S are suddenly spelling themselves differently, here is the answer:

> It's not a name change. More a re-brand.
>
> We have decided to write our name, K L P S from this moment forward.
>
> It's still pronounced (KOLLAPS\E).
>
> But to separate us from the awesome danish band, [Kollapse](https://soundsvegan.com/2021/07/kollapse-interview-en/) we thought this would
>
> be the right way to go.
