**All right, listen up! On March 21st, a proper banger of an album will be dropping—"I. Ancestral" by Kazea! This trio isn’t playing by any genre rules—they've smashed right through them. Expect a heavy-hitting mix of driving post-rock, haunting neo-folk melodies, and a slight pinch of sludge, creating a whole new sound world—from metal chaos to slow-burning intensity.**

"I. Ancestral" is coming out via Suicide Records. The band consists of ex-Orochen members Jonas Mattsson and Rasmus Lindblom, alongside Daniel Olsson (Hellsongs). The three met in the summer of 2023, clicked immediately, and boom—Kazea was born. With their debut album, they dive deep into themes of heritage, pain, and redemption, and they've had some top-tier sonic support from Ulf Blomberg (HoboRec, recording and mixing) and Magnus Lindberg (Cult of Luna, mastering).

The vibe? Massive. When they hit the studio, these three weren't messing about—they set out to create something grand. Drawing from the dark depths of the human mind, self-reflection, and their own existence, they've crafted a masterpiece well worth your ears. And trust me, this isn't only made for lovers of the darker genres—fans from all corners of the music scene will love it.

## There's more Kazea coming up!

Oh, and there's more—Kazea got some surprises lined up for us. Guest appearances on the album include vocalist Gina Wiklund (Black Birch, GASP) and Oskar Tornborg (Wormwood, Circular Ruin), adding even more depth to "I. Ancestral" and joining Kazea on their flight.

And there's already more Kazea on the way! Here's what the band has to say about their debut:

> "Kazea is an outlet for dark thoughts and feelings accumulated throughout life. "I. Ancestral" is the first of several releases sharing a common tonal language—though we always aim to push beyond genre boundaries."

The trio drew inspiration from the music of projects such as Wovenhand, Cult Of Luna, This Will Destroy You, Emma Ruth Rundle and Neurosis—also for their planned live performances.
