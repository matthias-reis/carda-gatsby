**"Speaker Rotations" by Nickolas Mohana is the first AKP Recordings album of 2025. The New York-based artist's newest work is the result of an ongoing improvisational practice of live experiments and extended techniques with feedback resonance.**

AKP Recordings (Los Angeles, California) made a limited cassette edition of the album to celebrate this milestone. The first single, "Night Horses", also comes with a video.

## "A refusal to genre"

Fans of inspiring instrumental ambient projects will love the skilful guitar, trombone, and piano arrangements on "Speaker Rotations". The record lives from its loops and well-arranged delay effects. Nickolas Mohana bedded them in some precious field recordings he combined with beautiful digital textures.

Here is what Nickolas says about "Speaker Rotations":

> "There is a refusal to genre in this recording that I've embraced in my studio practice where feeling becomes the catalyst, and these pieces were made in that mode—with an expressionist frame of mind, exploring the dissonance and impermanence of the sounds."

Listening to this record makes you feel like you are travelling in time—to a place of endless listening sessions in a beautiful, peaceful valley of music and joy. I recommend you listen to it over your headphones to experience every little loving detail the artist added to it.
