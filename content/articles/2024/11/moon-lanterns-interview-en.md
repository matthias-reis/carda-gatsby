**Moon Lanterns is an experimental psychedelic/space rock project from Denver, Colorado. I talked to founding member Jon about their debut EP, "Volume One". Half the band is vegan, so we had a lot to chat about besides their brilliant songs that you should definitely listen to right now!**

Moon Lanterns is:

- Jon Meyers
- Joe Lederman
- Cody Sickler
- Rick Garitta

**Anne:** "Volume One"—the title of your record sounds promising! Like there is a lot more to come. Are you already working on "Volume Two"?

**Jon:** Absolutely! "Volume Two" is already taking shape, and it feels like the next step in our sonic adventure. We're allowing the music to unfold naturally, letting each track reveal itself to us. However, a few songs are demoed, and it's just about the timing. There's a sense of excitement in not knowing exactly where it will go, but trusting that it will find its way.

**Anne:** What inspired you to write "Volume 1"?

## "Nature's rhythms inspire us"

![Moon Lanterns – "Volume One"](https://storage.googleapis.com/cardamonchai-media/2024-11-05/moon-lanterns-interview-soundsvegan-com-album-art-back-png-imagine-f8e8d8_85695b_948_951/640.webp 'Moon Lanterns – "Volume One"')

**Jon:** The ideas circling around it seem to touch on the feeling of distance and connection—how space—both physical and emotional—shapes the way we experience the world and each other. We're pulling from the natural rhythms around us, the cycles of the moon, the tides, and the stars. It's all about movement and stillness and how the two can coexist. The irony is not lost on us, considering that much of this record was recorded from a distance from each other.

**Anne:** So, is this also the theme of all the songs?

**Jon:** Yes, in a way. Each song reflects these bigger themes but is told in different ways. "Make Waves" uses the Pacific Northwest as a metaphor for riding the currents, feeling the momentum of life and growth. "One Up" is a tongue-in-cheek play on the ebbs and flows of an unpredictable psychedelic experience. "Let's Keep Moving" is our tribute to Krautrock; it starts with a simple foundation and builds upon it, taking you from one place to somewhere drastically different while riding the same pulse. "Comet Coma" is a song our drummer, Joe, and I had been toying with for years. It's a slow burn but has an amazing payoff, covering multiple genres and ending the EP with a bang.

**Anne:** When did you start making music together?

**Jon:** Moon Lanterns began not long ago, though it feels like we've been building toward this for much longer. We're a group of friends and artists who had been collaborating in different ways, and eventually, it all converged into this collective. It's almost like Moon Lanterns were always meant to be; we just had to discover it.

**Anne:** Can you tell me more about how Moon Lanterns came to be? How did you manage to connect several artists from different time zones?

**Jon:** The magic of technology! But really, it's more than just logistics. We were all craving a space to freely explore our creativity without the confines of a traditional band. Moon Lanterns became that space—a kind of refuge where we could experiment, share, and create, no matter where we were physically. The time zones don't feel like a barrier; they add to the rhythm of how we create, like different phases of the moon lighting the path at different times.

**Anne:** What does the fluid nature of your band—where roles and instruments are interchangeable—bring to your creative process? How is it different from creating music in a band with classic structures?

## "Making music with Moon Lanterns is like painting together"

**Jon:** It keeps things fresh and full of possibility. There's no rigidity in who plays what, which lets the music breathe and evolve in unexpected ways. One day, someone is on guitar; the next, they're on synth or percussion. It's like we're all painting on the same canvas, but with different brushes each time. It creates a kind of creative alchemy, which you don't often get in more structured environments. There's a sense of freedom in that.

**Anne:** You mentioned that for Moon Lanterns, there are no rules, deadlines, or boundaries in your music-making. So, does everything just fall into place at some point?

**Jon:** It's a bit of both. While we don't force anything, there's a kind of unspoken trust in the process—that eventually, everything will align. It's almost like letting the music reveal itself to us rather than trying to control it. Focus comes in waves, and we follow it, trusting that when the time is right, the pieces will come together in a way that feels true. It's more about the journey than the destination. That said, you do have to be intentional and pragmatic. Demos and ideas are exchanged freely, and lines of communication are always open.

**Anne:** Your music blends psychedelic influences with memorable hooks. How do you manage to balance experimental sounds and catchy melodies so well?

**Jon:** Psychedelic music, at its core, is about exploration and pushing boundaries, but hooks ground that journey, offering something for people to hold on to. We don't try to force the balance—it just happens naturally as we explore sounds and melodies that resonate with us. Even when we're experimenting, there's always a sense of cohesion, like all the parts know where they belong, even if we don't see it right away.

**Anne:** How do you manage the challenge of performing together when you're spread across different time zones?

**Jon:** It's definitely a challenge, but we've found ways to make it work. Our rehearsals and recordings happen mostly asynchronously, with each of us adding layers to the music in our own time. There's something beautiful about that—like passing a creative baton across time zones.

**Anne:** What's the creative process like for Moon Lanterns? Do you have a central hub for ideas, or is it more spontaneous and collaborative across distances?

**Jon:** It's a blend of both. We have a central hub—a digital space where ideas flow freely. Sometimes, it's as simple as someone sending a riff or a melody, and it grows from there. Other times, it's more spontaneous, where an idea sparks during a conversation or from visual inspiration. We embrace the distance and use it to our advantage, letting things develop in an organic way.

**Anne:** How has working with artists from around the globe influenced the visual aspects of Moon Lanterns? Would you like to share any standout collaborations?

## Musicians collaborating all over the globe

**Jon:** Working with artists globally has been a revelation. It expands the visual language of our music, allowing us to see it through different cultural lenses. One standout collaboration is with an artist who created the visualizers for "Comet Coma"—the way they captured the heart of the song was breathtaking.

**Anne:** What inspires the digital imagery and videos you create? Do you draw more from your music or external visual influences?

**Jon:** Music is always the foundation—it sets the tone, mood, and colours. But we're also deeply influenced by visual art, film, and nature. There's something about the way light shifts through a forest or the colours in an old psychedelic film that feeds into our visual storytelling. It's all about creating a visual echo to the sounds, something that enhances the journey the listener is on.

**Anne:** As a collective that values creative freedom, how do you decide when a piece of music or art is "complete"?

**Jon:** That's the million-dollar question! For us, completion feels more like a moment of letting go than reaching a finish line. There's a sense of knowing when a piece has said what it needs to say—when it's ready to stand on its own. Sometimes, that happens quickly; other times, it's a slower process, but it always feels right when we finally release it into the world.

**Anne:** Can you describe the kind of immersive sonic adventure you aim to create for your listeners? How do you hope your audience feels while experiencing your music?

**Jon:** We want our listeners to feel like they're being pulled into another world—one that's both familiar and strange—comforting and exhilarating. It's about creating a space where people can lose themselves, explore their thoughts, and feel connected to something bigger. We hope they feel a sense of wonder, like they're on a journey without a set destination but enjoying every moment of it.

**Anne:** How has being part of Moon Lanterns sparked your own creativity? Can you share any personal growth or discoveries through this journey?

## "Moon Lanterns helped me to learn to trust into the process"

![Moon Lanterns – "Volume One"](https://storage.googleapis.com/cardamonchai-media/2024-11-05/moon-lanterns-interview-soundsvegan-com-album-art-cover-png-imagine-181808_5c4d3c_724_731/640.webp 'Moon Lanterns – "Volume One"')

**Jon:** Moon Lanterns has been a catalyst for my own creativity in ways I didn't expect. It's made me more open to collaboration and more willing to embrace the unknown. I've learned to trust the process more, to let go of control, and to allow the music and art to take shape in their own time. It's been incredibly freeing and has deepened my love for the creative journey.

**Anne:** Do you have any specific favourite artists that have influenced your sound or approach to music?

**Jon:** Definitely. We're influenced by a wide range of artists—Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, My Morning Jacket, Radiohead, Queens of the Stone Age, and Rush. Each of these artists has a way of pushing boundaries while staying true to their sound, and that's something we aspire to. We love the idea of combining intricate melodies with experimental sounds, creating something that feels timeless yet always evolving.

**Anne:** You mentioned a couple of members of Moon Lanterns are vegan. Congrats! Did you inspire each other to make this decision?

**Jon:** It's funny how that worked out! We didn't set out to be that way, but it's something that naturally happened as we became more aware of our choices.

**Anne:** As a vegan myself for many years, this has become a big part of me, my life, and even my personality. The decision not to support animal cruelty any more changes you and your view of the world. I'd love to know what has changed for you as a result of the change. Has it also changed your way of making music?

**Jon:** Absolutely, it changes how you see the world. It's like pulling back a curtain and seeing things from a broader perspective. For us, it's deepened our connection to the natural world and the importance of empathy. In terms of music, it's made us more intentional with our message and the energy we put out. There's a quiet mindfulness that comes with these choices, and I think that seeps into the way we create.

**Anne:** Would you use your music as a vehicle to educate other people about issues such as animal rights, cruelty, and climate change?

## "Music helps with spreading awareness"

**Jon:** Music is such a powerful tool for spreading awareness. While we don't set out to preach, we believe in using our platform to inspire positive change. If our music can spark a conversation about these issues or plant a seed of thought in someone's mind, then that's a beautiful outcome. Art has always been a vehicle for reflection, and we're open to letting our message evolve as we do.

**Anne:** If there was one thing in the world you could change—what would it be and why?

**Jon:** If I could change one thing, it would be to cultivate more empathy in the world. So many of the challenges we face, whether personal or global, stem from a lack of understanding and compassion. If we could all take a moment to truly listen to one another, to see the world through someone else's eyes, I think we'd be in a much better place.

**Anne:** Very well said! Thanks so much for taking the time! It was a pleasure talking to you. I wish you all the best in fulfilling your plans! Let's stay in touch!

**Jon:** Thank you, Anne! It was a pleasure speaking with you, too. I appreciate the thoughtful questions and look forward to staying in touch. Here's to more music and collaboration in the future!
