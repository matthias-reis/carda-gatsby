**The new I Hear Sirens album, "Acheron", is currently on my record player, and I absolutely have to tell you about this gem. It's definitely one of the top post-rock records of 2024, and you shouldn't miss out on being enchanted by it. I Hear Sirens released it on August 23rd, so you can already listen to it.**

In terms of sound, this feels like coming home to me. From the first chord of the first track on "Acheron" called "Watcher/Prey", I instinctively know, this album is special. I love how thoughtful, delicate melodies suddenly turn into heavy and impenetrable walls of sound. As I continue listening, I quickly realise the concept of "Acheron" is not at all solely based on the stark contrasts of the eight tracks.

There are eight stories on this album—told entirely without words, making them all even more profound. Woven into a coherent storyline, they form a strong, intricate edifice of anger, despair, curiosity, love and endless playfulness.

## I Hear Sirens delivers eight thrilling acts

![I Hear Sirens – "Acheron"](https://storage.googleapis.com/cardamonchai-media/2024-08-29/i-hear-sirens-acheron-album-art-by-enrique-morales-soundsvegan-com-jpg-imagine-181838_363352_1084_1076/640.webp 'I Hear Sirens – "Acheron"')

"Acheron" is masterly staged and composed like a dramatic stage play. But the curtain simply doesn't fall. When hearing the last note, I immediately feel the urge to listen to the album again. It's post-rock the way I like it—full of musical diversity, magical, creative, beautiful small details and feel-good moments.

At the same time, I Hear Sirens' "Acheron" is heavier and more multi-layered than their last album, "Stella Mori". Daved Herris (guitar and keys), David Qualls (drums, samples, and drum programming), Adrienne Robson (bass), and Wes Johnson (guitar and keys) are venturing into new realms but without losing touch with their characteristic, emotionally charged sound.

Darker, heavier and more experimental—that's basically how you could summarise it. But there is much more to it. Inspired by Greek mythology, the result of IHS' work is a sonic hero's journey—a true one-of-a-kind one. "Acheron" has its name from the death's-head hawk moth "Acherontia Atropos". Acheron, the god of the underworld river of lost souls, wanders from door to door through all eight pieces and enchants with his mysticism.

## Horror movie sounds and mystical moments

In addition to the world of the Greek gods, I Hear Sirens were influenced by various horror films when writing the tracks. I can easily imagine the unrelenting, dark tension on "Acheron" as background music for one of the great classics from this movie genre. Just like in these films, there are moments of light, calm, and catharsis on the new IHS album, drawing me deeper and deeper as I listen until I am completely enveloped by the music.

I Hear Sirens have never stood still since their formation by Daved and David in 2005. With "Acheron", they've taken another step forward in their musical evolution, once again showing how versatile this band is. This time, Eric Olofson (piano intro track 5 "011"), Trevor Smith (second bass track 3 "Pale Rider") and Sarita Ford (second bass track 1 "Watcher/Prey") supported IHS musically–alongside their brand-new guitarist Wes Johnson, who is now a permanent member of the band. I Hear Sirens produced their latest masterpiece together with Wes Johnson (engineering) and Matt Mascarenas (additional engineering). The art in the booklet and on the vinyl sleeve is by Enrique Morales. Sean Oliver took the photos.
