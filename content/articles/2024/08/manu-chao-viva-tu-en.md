**Thoughtful, encouraging, gentle and wonderful—that's the sound of the new album by vegan musician Manu Chao. Yes, you read that right! Everyone eagerly awaiting new music from this exceptional artist can now celebrate. He's back again! "Viva Tu" will be released on 20 September. I've already got a taster for you. You can already listen to three pre-releases. The best thing is: I'm already sharing the first three songs with you in this preview!**

Manu Chao's first studio album in 17 years contains some exciting collaborations—including one with country legend Willie Nelson. 13 brand-new songs await you on "Viva Tu". Manu already released three of the pieces in advance: "Viva Tu", "São Paulo Motoboy", and "Tu Te Vas". They sound as versatile, open-minded and language-loving as their names promise. And ten more tracks of this kind await you on "Viva Tu"! So, you can definitely look forward to it and send off your pre-order now.

## This world needs "Viva Tu"

Manu composed a pot-pourri of soulful ballads, danceable moments, and passionate vocals in French, Portuguese, English, and Spanish—flavoured with stories about farewells and hope. The wait was definitely worth it. This record rewards us for being patient! Manu's new music makes the world a bit better again. Just at the right moment: Manu Chao will make the dark season a little brighter for us—I promise!

## A unique album full of sonic highlights

The album is characterised by warmth and cheerfulness. Although it does become melancholic here and there, Manu Chao always finds his way back to his positive and happy demeanour. These tracks seem so familiar and calm! It's almost like meeting a dear friend again after a long time. Everything is like it used to be—as if you had never been apart.

As we know him, Manu combined elements of chanson, rumba, cumbia, and dub—among others. He invites his fans on a journey around the world—from the beaches of the Caribbean to the Mediterranean and back again. What sounds candyfloss soft at first includes depth and thought-provoking moments. The first track, "Vecinos en el mar", is about the uncertain fate of mankind, and the artist reflects on the end of the world as we know it.

The second track, "La couleur du temps", is about the harsh reality in which you sometimes have to clench your fists to forget. "River why" warns of the global rise of neoliberalism and the dangers it harbours. "Where is life on the bridge that crosses a dry river?" Manu asks.

You can listen to "Viva Tu" for yourself. It's the first song Manu released upfront.

Manu Chao recorded the third song, "Heaven's bad day", together with Willie Nelson. The track contains allusions to the carefree, expansive "wild west" style and thus ties in perfectly with the critical tones the previous tracks already contain.

The latest pre-release, "Tu Te Vas" (French: "You're going away"), is about two people who've decided to no longer go their way together. In a duet with rapper Laeti ("Valide"), the song tells the story of a past love, looking into the future hopeful. Even if the lyrics ("j'reviendrai jamais" – "I'll never come back") sound final, there is still a silver lining on the horizon. And wasn't that precisely what always made us so happy about Manu Chao's music? Its lightness and cheerfulness? Don't worry: Manu Chao has our backs!

"Coração no mar" playfully tells of the heart of the sea. Like gentle waves that wash up on the beach, gently taking you away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life on a rainy Wednesday afternoon. "Cuatro calles" is also about the melancholy that comes through the certainty that things will never be the same again. Fortunately, Manu brings back hope, spreading a sense of cosy bliss. Anyone encountering the artist on his travels will probably recognise the piece. He has been playing it in various versions for many years and has now finally immortalised it on this album.

The album continues with "La colilla" and "São Paulo motoboy". "São Paulo motoboy" is already available on your music streaming platform. Both tracks are strongly reminiscent of Manu Chao's earlier pieces and once again combine strong political statements with cheerful vibes.

Another chanson-style love story follows with "Tom et Lola". "Lonely night" picks up rhythmically and leads perfectly to the final track, "Tantas tierras". Once again, it's about the uncertainty of the future and the question of what happens next:

> "Todo el mundo sin saber la que algun dia va a caer." – "Everyone doesn't know what will happen one day."

But hope never leaves us:

> "No estamos solos." – "We are not alone."

In the past 17 years, Manu Chao always remained true to himself. He continued travelling, bringing his music from city to city, from circus tent to festival and from park to tavern—together with friends such as Argentinian guitarist and ukulele player Lucky Salvadori and Galician percussionist Miguel Rumbao. His wanderlust has never left him; you can hear it in his songs. They tell the stories of the most diverse places, linking them together, showing how similar we all are if you break it down into bits.

## Manu Chao's musical development

For Manu, his music has always been an outlet that helped him process things and a way to raise his voice for social and environmental justice. During his recording hiatus, he remained active and supported various activism groups, associations, and communities. He played at events such as the Baganga Sessions in Bombay and the Matalunes Sessions in Barcelona. The artist supported the protests against the power plant in Topli Dol, Serbia. He sent his support video to the activists in the fight against mega-mining in the Patagonian province of Chubut and took part in the streaming event to protect indigenous communities and the rainforest organised by SOS Rainforest.

"Viva Tu" is Manu Chao's fifth studio album. Since 2018, he's also been releasing free songs on his website—solo or with Chalart58, with whom he also released the vinyl compilation Inna Reggae Style. Among many others, you can also find his collaborations with Kleia Renesi under the name Ti.Po.Ta., his musical contributions to Playing For Change, Bunny Wailer, Mermans Mosengo and David Hidalgo from Los Lobos and the Pluma Sessions with Mr Pluma.

Growing up in Paris in the 1980s as the child of Basque and Galician immigrants, he's always absorbed various musical styles and never let genre boundaries stop him. He made a living as a street musician early and eventually found his calling in it. As a member of bands such as Hot Pants and Los Carayos, he experimented with rockabilly, rock, and cabaret and finally ended up in the Mano Negra project with his brother Antoine in 1987. Together, they combined political punk music with pachanga and rumba, among other genres, and shaped his current style. Their four albums are now an essential part of the history of political music, having a lasting impact. Even after the band broke up in 1995, their songs continue to be played up and down. Their legendary boat tour as a circus will probably remain unforgotten forever.

In Manu's years on the road, he travelled to numerous countries and landed worldwide hits with songs such as "Candestino", "Desaparecido", "Me gustas tu", and "La marea".
