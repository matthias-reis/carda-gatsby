**Beth Gibbons of Portishead has announced her first solo album! The wish that many fans have shared for so long is finally coming true! You can already listen to the first single entitled "Floating on a Moment"—the whole album, "Lives Outgrown", will be available on May 17th. It will be available in analogue and digital formats—pre-orders are already underway.**

A role model for millions of female musicians and the voice of at least one generation—that's Beth Gibbons, the woman who made Portishead the band it is. After a few years of silence, the reserved artist has a big surprise in store for us. The solo album "Lives Outgrown" is ready, and we can already place our pre-orders. It will be released with Domino Recordings.

## Farewell to loved ones

Beth produced the record with James Ford, who you may already know from the Arctic Monkeys and Depeche Mode. It contains a total of ten tracks that she has recorded over the last decade. In her official press release, the musician talks about the topics that "Lives Outgrown" deals with: Motherhood, anxiety, menopause, and mortality. The artist started creating the album when she had to say goodbye to numerous loved ones and friends.

> "People started dying. When you're young, you never know the endings, you don't know how it's going to pan out. You think, 'We're going to get beyond this. It's going to get better.' Some endings are hard to digest… I realized what life was like with no hope, and that was a sadness I'd never felt. Before, I had the ability to change my future, but when you're up against your body, you can't make it do something it doesn't want to do."

The first single, "Floating on a Moment", notes the album's themes. You can listen to it below—I've added the music video Beth recorded with director Tony Oursler (known for his work with David Bowie) to this article. In addition to the artist herself, the video features images of nature and the omnipresent destruction of our times. Tony Oursler has given the whole thing a colourful science-fiction touch.

Following her release, Beth Gibbons is planning to go on tour. I have included the tour dates below for you. You can see her live on stage in cities like Berlin, London, and Paris.

## Beth Gibbons will start touring in May

Following the reunion of Portishead (after their last studio album together, "Third", released in 2008) and their joint shows with Idles in 2022 and the remastered version of their album "Roseland NYC live" for the twenty-fifth anniversary in 2013, Beth's album is the next chapter. The first single, "Floating on a Moment", already has it all, and I'm pretty sure "Floating on a Moment" will be big! I've already marked May 17th in my calendar—I'm eagerly awaiting this event!

By the way, have you listened to the two albums Beth Gibbons recorded with Rustin Man (2002) and Henryk Górecki and the Radio Symphony Orchestra (2019)? If not, I highly recommend you to check out "Out of Season" (with Rustin Man) and Symphony "No. 3 [Symphony of Sorrowful Songs]"( with Henryk Górecki).
