**Codespeaker just released their second album, "Scavenger". Following their critically acclaimed debut, the band has taken things one step further with this record, sure to warm the hearts of fans of Cult of Luna and Neurosis. Expect haunting, unforgettable, hypnotic riffs paired with emotionally charged vocals. Join Codespeaker on their journey into the darker realms of the human psyche starting November 8, 2024—the day "Scavenger" dropped on Ripcord Records.**

Several music magazines have already heaped praise on this band from the Scottish capital. If you haven't heard of them yet, don't waste any more time—dive into their music now. It's well worth it. When Codespeaker first gained attention in 2023, sharing stages with acts like Pound, Sylvaine, and Hundred Year Old Man, they quickly secured a permanent spot on the playlists of countless post-metal enthusiasts. Their unique mix of atmospheric, dark, and heavy elements is both memorable and distinct.

## Furious, political post-metal

With "Scavenger", Codespeaker solidified and expanded their reputation for delivering thunderous drums, colossal guitar work, and hypnotic, sprawling riffs. Since the release of their debut, three new members have joined the band, completing their vision. Reflecting on the new album, the band shared:

> "While our self-titled album was only released two years ago, we started writing it five years prior. A lot has changed since then. 'Scavenger' is more pointed and aggressive, influenced by the new members, evolving tastes, and the darkening sociopolitical landscape we found ourselves in. Our first album had anger but also a warmth and wonder about the human experience. 'Skavenger' doesn't have that same warmth-it's much more vitriolic and desperate. The lyrics focus on the faults of power structures and the struggles of those who bear the brunt of them, lamenting the lack of any real alternative. It's an ode to the powerless, a fitting theme for these times."

If you're in the mood for angry, politically charged post-metal, make sure to listen to "Scavenger". The album is available at your favourite music store and on all major streaming platforms.
