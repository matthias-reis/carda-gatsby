**Just a few days ago, I shared the interview I did with Moby this summer on social media again. Today, I have another surprise for you: Moby has released a stunning remix version of the album we discussed during our conversation. "Always Centered At Night – Remixes" is available in record shops from today and, of course, can also be streamed online.**

The musician, vegan animal rights activist, and producer has unveiled his new remix album across two discs featuring an impressive 58 tracks. The album revolves entirely around nocturnal remixes. This LP follows his celebrated "Quiet Home" DJ Remix and his sold-out EU/UK tour in September, during which Moby celebrated 25 years of Play while supporting animal welfare. All proceeds from the shows were donated to various organisations.

## Powerful Voices, Deep Emotions

![Moby – "Always Centered At Night – Remixes"](https://storage.googleapis.com/cardamonchai-media/2024-12-06/moby-always-centered-at-night-remix-soundsvegan-com-album-artwork-jpeg-imagine-080808_35322f_3000_3000/640.webp 'Moby – "Always Centered At Night – Remixes"')

Today's album release is accompanied by Moby's latest single, the "dark1" remix of "Wild Flame", created in collaboration with Danae. Her outstanding vocals blend effortlessly with soft congas, spacey synth sounds, and intricate rhythms, giving the original 2023 track a fresh, dazzling makeover.

Moby describes "Always Centered At Night" as a deeply special project. Particularly so because he collaborated with extraordinary artists on 13 of the tracks – some well-known and others who, after hearing the album, you'll instinctively want to explore further. For instance, Moby recorded the lead single "Dark Days" with soul-jazz singer-songwriter Lady Blackbird. Her deep and unforgettable voice transforms the rhythmic track into a soulful gem. Other artists you might recognise include Serpentwithfeet ("On Air") and the late Benjamin Zephaniah ("Where Is Your Pride?"). Reflecting on Zephaniah, Moby shares:

> "As a vegan activist and wise, compassionate man, Benjamin inspired me for many years. I hope "Where Is Your Pride?" honours his legacy and draws attention to his life, work, and principles".

## Moby's next Step in the Always Centered At Night Project

With "Always Centered At Night", Moby has continued the project he began in 2022. He likens the experience to visiting New York record shops in the 1980s, where he would encounter unfamiliar and exciting sounds that broadened his musical horizons. The project enabled him to collaborate with exceptional songwriters and vocalists, creating tracks inspired and shaped by these discoveries.

In his quest for new sounds, Moby has become a collector of voices. A connoisseur of vocal timbre and texture – from Bessie Jones and Vera Hall to legends like David Bowie, Ozzy Osbourne, and Britney Spears—he's always seeking unique vocal qualities. In his words:

> "Sometimes it's about going on YouTube. Sometimes, it's Spotify. Other times, I walk around lower Manhattan and visit karaoke bars, where I've found a few singers. It's a constant process of searching for voices and getting excited and inspired when I find a wonderful voice."

## A new world of soundscapes

With "Always Centered At Night – Remixes", Moby has crafted a sonic world that feels like a nocturnal journey through the human soul – at times melancholic, at others electrifying, but always deeply moving. Each of the 58 tracks is like a mosaic piece in the collection of collaborations between Moby and the exceptional musicians he highlights on this album.

Moby has created an entirely new soundscape based on the original material. It's enriched with unexpected elements while preserving—and in some cases amplifying—the essence of each track. "Always Centered At Night – Remixes" is an album that will captivate everyone, from loyal fans to newbies who may not have delved deeply into Moby's music but are open to embarking on a new auditory adventure.

What makes "Always Centered At Night – Remixes" so unique is the emotional depth amplified by the versatility of its remixes. Moby intertwines nostalgic nods to his musical roots with modern, occasionally avant-garde sounds. The result is a listening experience that invites you to explore uncharted territory—gently yet thrillingly.

The way Moby merges intimate vocal passages with expansive, cinematic soundscapes is unmistakable and unparalleled. "Always Centered At Night – Remixes" is much more than just "another remix album". It's a homage to the magic of music, and artistic expression's transformative richness—an extended love letter to the sound of the night.
