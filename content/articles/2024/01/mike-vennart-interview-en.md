**"Mike Vennart Interview"—yes, you read that right! I interviewed the musical mastermind Mike Vennart (Vennart, Oceansize, Biffy Clyro) about his upcoming (February 2nd) new solo album, "Forgiveness & The Grain". We also talked about the world getting crueller and crueller these days and how to motivate yourself when starting a creative process. Please enjoy!**

**Anne:** Mike! First, thanks so much for giving me the opportunity and time for this interview! As a big fan of Vennart, Oceansize, Biffy Clyro, Empire State Bastard, and British Theatre, it means the world, and it is a big honour for me to have you as a guest! How are you doing today? Looking forward to the release of your fourth solo album, "Forgiveness & The Grain", I guess?

**Mike:** Hi Anne. I'm OK. I really am looking forward to getting this record out. It's been percolating for so long!

**Anne:** What is "Forgiveness & The Grain" all about? What is the central theme?

## "The world seems to get crueller and crueller"

**Mike:** Well, forgiveness isn't something easily afforded. Redemption isn't a common arc in the story of anyone these days really. The world just seems to get crueller and crueller. More resentful. More willing to destroy. This record is kind of begging for humility—to go against the current grain.

**Anne:** Which one is your favourite song on the record and why?

**Mike:** Probably "The Japanese No". It's kind of a plea for attention, for affection. But understanding that the longing I feel is part of that love—like a rat chasing a trail of cheese.

It's the most psychedelic song on the record in that it's lush and all swirly, but it's quite abrasive.

**Anne:** I read you stayed true to yourself and produced "Forgiveness & The Grain" without any external PR, management, producers, record companies and all that stuff—like all of your records. I am sure this is quite a challenge, and I'm beyond impressed with how perfect things always turn out and how brilliant your records come out working all by yourself—having the opportunity to let your creativity run free. So, there are quite a few hurdles in working this way for sure, but I'm also pretty sure it also has its benefits. As an artist who knows both worlds, what would you say is the best aspect about working all by yourself and without the whole circus?

## "I wrote the song 'R U The Future??' while walking down Oldham Street"

!["Mike Vennart. Bild/Picture: Mike Vennart](https://storage.googleapis.com/cardamonchai-media/2024-01-26/mike-vennart-interview-soundsvegan-com-5-jpg-imagine-282828_717171_1024_768/640.webp '"Feeding Tomorrow" Screening. Bild/Picture: Feeding Tomorrow Instagram')

**Mike:** It's fairly simple—releasing the records myself means I make all the money—_all_ of it. That means I can pay my ever-increasing rent. When I've released records on labels—including major labels—I haven't made a fucking penny.

**Anne:** When did you start the writing process, and how long did it take you to finish it?

**Mike:** I dunno, really. I'm kinda making stuff all the time. I wrote one song while walking down Oldham Street in Manchester. That's "R U The Future??". It was a struggle to get going because I was very proud of "In The Dead, Dead Wood". I thought it couldn't be bettered and that maybe noone needs a tenth album by me. I mean, who does? But making stuff is what I do, and I much prefer that to playing live these days.

**Anne:** When it comes to writing songs, what would you say is your most significant source of motivation? What gets you into a flow?

## "Inspiration must find you busy"

!["Mike Vennart. Bild/Picture: Mike Vennart](https://storage.googleapis.com/cardamonchai-media/2024-01-26/mike-vennart-interview-soundsvegan-com-3-jpg-imagine-383838_767676_1024_768/640.webp '"Feeding Tomorrow" Screening. Bild/Picture: Feeding Tomorrow Instagram')

**Mike:** It can be anything, but it took a while to learn to actually show up. Inspiration must find you busy. I used to just sit around smoking dope all day, waiting for inspiration to strike. It rarely did. So I tend to just improvise, plug in a guitar or a synth, a couple of pedals and just find stuff.

**Anne:** How much Empire State Bastard influence lies in the new Vennart stuff?

**Mike:** Not really. ESB has certain parameters that don't really translate. There's a bit of the drone-sludge vibe in "Seventy Six", but my own stuff tends to be a bit more emotive, and this might be the most emotive record I've ever done.

**Anne:** How would you describe the differences between working on your solo projects and working with Oceansize in the past and with Biffy Clyro?

**Mike:** Well, Oceansize was a fight to the death in every single decision that had to be made. The music is so fucking good because we agonised over every single detail. It wasn't easy, but the work stands up, I think. Nothing compares to Biffy cos they write the tunes, and I just work out how to fit in without being too much of a distraction. To make something that's already great a bit greater.

**Anne:** As I mentioned, you're part of many projects, most of which started by yourself. And you're also doing most of the management, producing, PR and stuff. How do you find the time for all this hard work? Do you want to tell me your secret?

## "Jess takes care of the artwork and the shop"

!["Mike Vennart. Bild/Picture: Mike Vennart](https://storage.googleapis.com/cardamonchai-media/2024-01-26/mike-vennart-interview-soundsvegan-com-2-jpg-imagine-282828_676767_1024_768/640.webp '"Feeding Tomorrow" Screening. Bild/Picture: Feeding Tomorrow Instagram')

**Mike:** There's not much to it. It's a lot of work, and my partner Jess is a lot more level-headed than I am and hugely artistic. Jess takes care of all the artwork and the shop end of stuff. That helps me enormously because I'm not very good at reading stuff or working the internet.

**Anne:** If I am correctly informed, you wrote the songs for your 2020 EP,"Backseat Hards", on tour with Biffy Clyro. That must've been pretty inspiring. It is based on field recordings combined with your voice and your Fender Acoustasonic—a complete contrast to your new album, "Forgiveness & The Grain". I like that a lot! Is there a story like this behind "Forgiveness & The Grain", too?

**Mike:** Well, the "Backseat Hards" thing was just a spontaneous, improvised collection of ideas I made on the tour bus. The tour hit the skids a couple of times due to illnesses of varying severity, and, being our first tour since the pandemic, it was full of mixed emotions. That EP was made during an enforced trip across middle America, using an electro-acoustic Fender guitar, a couple of mad pedals and my iPhone. Field recordings were from roadside motels, the back lounge and my bunk. "Forgiveness & The Grain" is actual songs, with tunes and words.

**Anne:** Things have changed and become much worse over the last few years. Starting with war all over the world, people drowning in the Mediterranean Sea to the nazi disease growing again over here in Germany and Brexit and all the sad stories around it in Britain. How are you dealing with all this shit?

**Mike:** I'm not dealing with it very well at the moment, truth be told. My encounter with the far-right figurehead has resurfaced, and I'm reliving the horror of being harassed everywhere online. Fucking little piggies. They throw their shit at me all day, every day. Alas, there's no point throwing shit at pigs because pigs like it.

**Anne:** I am so sorry you have to deal with all of this shit. I hope it gets better very soon. But you're right, they don't deserve us to feel shit because of their shitty behavior.

I think all of the topics I brought up in my previous question are reasons to raise your voice and never to stop being political or at least anti-fascist. I see a lot of anti-fascist and anti-bullshit content on your social media profiles, too, so I thought I'd give it a shot and ask you this question. I hope that's OK. Why do you believe there are so many people that seem to don't give a shit about helping the people and the animals on this planet (and not at least also the earth itself!) to survive by speaking up sometimes?

**Mike:** It's the million-dollar question, Anne. Why are people so fucking inhumane? Why are they so desperate to exude nothing but absolute vileness? How did we get here?

**Anne:** If there was one thing in the world you could change. What would it be and why?

**Mike:** Too many to list, but on the world stage, I'd destroy the Conservative Party and Rupert Murdoch. They are cancers in modern society, and the world would be an infinitely better place without their bilge.

## "I'm working on a solo show"

!["Mike Vennart. Bild/Picture: Mike Vennart](https://storage.googleapis.com/cardamonchai-media/2024-01-26/mike-vennart-interview-soundsvegan-com-1-jpg-imagine-282828_767676_1024_768/640.webp '"Feeding Tomorrow" Screening. Bild/Picture: Feeding Tomorrow Instagram')

**Anne:** Your release day for "Forgiveness & The Grain" is February 2nd. Wow, time is running so fast! I'm really looking forward to it. The pre-released single "Fractal" is very promising. Really, heavy-weighted and also political. It is also a great contrast to your 2020 EP, "Backseat Hards", which was based on field recordings combined with your voice and your Fender Acoustasonic. I like that a lot! What are your plans for after the release? I'd love to see you live on stage soon, and I am sure many, many people feel that way, too! Will we meet you on the continent again soon?

**Mike:** I dunno. I'm trying to work up a solo show where I can show up with a bunch of loud amps, pedals, and loopers and just make a racket on my own for a bit.

**Anne:** Once again, thanks very much for taking the time! It's been a pleasure talking to you! I wish you all the best for your upcoming plans and the album!

**Mike:** Thank you, Anne!
