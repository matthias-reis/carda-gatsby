**I had an inspiring chat with Mark and Krzysiek from Give Up To Failure. The five musicians from Wrocław, Poland, deliver great post-music influenced by several fascinating genres. Their current album, "Cocoon", is about love, depression, self-destruction, insomnia, crying for help, and trying to find yourself and becoming a better human.**

**Anne:** Hi! Thanks very much for taking the time for this interview! How are you doing today? You just released your album, "Cocoon"—which is brilliant, by the way—Are you satisfied with the outcome of your work?

**Krzysiek:** Thank you. Here in Poland, we have really crazy weather. It's windy and snowy, but I admire it from the window and listen to music. As for your second question - I'm very happy with the album. I think we all are.

## "It's been a busy time"

**Mark:** Hi Anne. I can say that I'm proud of it over time. It's been a really busy time with a lot of stressful moments while we were working on this album.

**Anne:** The style of the ten songs on "Cocoon" ranges from shoegaze to post-rock and from post-metal to ambient and dream pop. These are a lot of influences! Are those your favourite music genres?

**Krzysiek:** Yes, but I also like other genres like synth-pop, industrial rock, electronica, and all kinds of atmospheric music. But I think the genres you mentioned are the easiest to find on our record.

**Mark:** I don't really care about genres. I'm writing music straight from the heart. It often happens to be associated with genres that I'm not even familiar with.

**Anne:** "Cocoon" sounds as if there is a story behind your album—A thread that leads through the songs. Do you want to share it?

## "'Cocoon' tells about the not-so-happy parts of life"

**Mark:** It's good to hear you can feel it. There's not this one leading thread. It just tells about some not-so-happy things that happen to you on your way through life. We just like to make things sound like it's one big story, not only with lyrics but with music also. Lyrically it's self-reflective, and mostly it says about burying part of yourself that is rotten to become a better human.

**Anne:** Do you have any special bands or artists you would like to mention that inspired you a lot?

**Krzysiek:** Too many to list them all, always when someone asks. I have a blank in my head. Let me think: Emma Ruth Rundle, Manes, Alcest, Eve Vine, Deserta, Seigmen, The White Birch and many more.

**Mark:** Brand New, O'Brother, Biffy Clyro.

**Anne:** A lot of great doomy and gloomy, thoughtful music comes from Poland. The music scene must be very creative and flourishing. What do you think are the reasons for that?

**Krzysiek:** Hm, it's hard to say. Maybe the weather. For example, it's really gloomy outside the window now. I also think that our country is not an easy place to live. Our political and economic situation is really worrisome, so that may have an impact, too or maybe we're just sensitive people.

**Anne:** You described your music with the words "from chaos in the head to peace in the heart"—I think it makes a lot of sense when I'm listening to your songs. Can you explain that a little further?

## "We love the softer parts of our music"

**Mark:** I came up with this one trying to describe the sound of this album when I realised there are many quiet-to-loud moments in our songs. We like to make something soft, moving, sometimes barely hearable before we explode and destroy everything.

**Anne:** If I am correctly informed, you founded Give Up To Failure in 2019. "Cocoon" is already your second full-length album; you've also put out some singles. That's a lot of output so far. Do you plan to keep that tempo? What do your future plans look like? Maybe there's also a tour coming up?

## "There already is a vision for our next album"

**Krzysiek:** We are thinking about a short tour; however, there are a few things we need to sort out before, but we have some plans.

**Mark:** I must admit I was a bit tired after we finished working on that album because I was also responsible for the production side—mixing and mastering. It really gets you when you decide to work like this with the songs you wrote. But I'm in constant writing mode. I have a vision for our next album.

**Anne:** If you could pick one venue to play at—could be a club or festival—which one would it be?

**Krzysiek:** Basically, I think I like clubs more, but I've done a lot of them, so now I'd rather play at festivals.

**Mark:** There are plenty of beautiful ballrooms in the USA. I would go for one of these.

**Anne:** You are a band of five. That's a lot of creativity, ideas, and a few different musical roots. Where do you see them? Have some of you been part of other projects before joining, Give Up To Failure?

## "My other project is called Fragile Thoughts"

**Krzysiek:** Mark and I were part of the new wave/post-punk band Aviaries. We released one album and then split up. Occasionally, I also create my own music. It's really calm and atmospheric music. I called the project Fragile Thoughts.

**Anne:** I browsed through your social media profiles and noticed your artworks are very artsy—I like them a lot! Do you want to tell me who came up with them and brought them to life?

**Mark:** Our good friend Rafał Wekiera[^1] is responsible for that. We have known each other for quite some time, and it came out really fast that we have a lot in common when it comes to music, photography etc. We express ourselves through music mainly, but the graphic side is a massive part of it.

**Anne:** If there was one thing in the world, you could change. What would it be and why?

**Krzysiek:** Honestly, it's quite a tough question for me. I don't know if I shouldn't change myself instead.

**Mark:** We must become the change we want to see in the world.

Give Up To Failure are Mark Magick Krzysztof "Krzysiek" Młyńczak, Dominik Półtorak, Michał Szczypek, and Rafał Wekiera.
