**Artificial Owl Recordings released a magnificent new ambient EP today: "Excogitation" by One Of Them brings us all back to the ground in these uncertain and gloomy times, letting us reflect on what was and what is to come.**

The EP is available as 12" vinyl, as a cassette or via Bandcamp. Yoyaku Distribution distributes it worldwide for the New York indie label Artificial Owl. I'll link to Bandcamp below, so you can listen to it right away—you can believe me: It's worth it!

After a feature on the Ambient Focus Show on BBC6 radio (which I also recommend to you if you haven't heard of it yet), "Excogitation" is finally officially out. It is Niko Dalagelis' aka One Of Them's fourth release.

## Spacial soundscapes

You will find two fascinating ethereal and atmospheric ambient pieces on the EP—dreamlike, playful and made for the coming quiet season. With the A-side ("Excogitation 1"), Niko draws a vivid picture of snow-covered landscapes under which the world recovers from its injuries. Its inhabitants gather new energy and wait for spring to start anew with new ideas and fresh drive.

The B-side fits seamlessly into this picture, spinning the story further. The paths branch out to explore new landscapes.

The textures of sound the musician combined are multi-layered and exciting, exploring the play of space and time, light and darkness. Keys, synths, chimes and an implied clarinet here and there combine to create an imaginative bouquet.

## A transcendental listening experience

As a basis for his EP, One Of Them used a randomised sequence triggered by an SH-01A and a Digitone. He wants to direct the listener's focus inward consciously.

While listening, we are supposed to deal with our thoughts and feelings—which seems to work wonderfully. The two pieces, each lasting just over 23 minutes, have a meditative effect on me. What shakes me to the core is: It was after I'd described my impressions of the two songs on this record and written down my thoughts about the future and the past, winter and spring, that I read the press release for it and had to realise: It talks about the exact same things!

That sounds downright transcendental, doesn't it? The artist wants to take us on a serene sound journey and create a harmonious connection between the mind and the music—inspired by unconventional thinking.

I'm surprised, flashed and relaxed at the same time. The kidnapping and sound journey thing definitely worked for me—wow!

By the way, Niko Dalagelis puts "Excogitation" into words like this:

> "I tried to open a gateway to a state of blissful self-exploration. Through enchanting sounds, soothing atmospheres and contemplative nuances, this work acts as an auditory catalyst, creating a link between the listener's consciousness and the musical experience."

Sounds good, doesn't it? Yes, and it feels good, too. You better listen to it immediately!
