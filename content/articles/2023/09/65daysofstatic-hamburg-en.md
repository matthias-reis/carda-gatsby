**65daysofstatic and Sugar Horse live at Knust, Hamburg—We couldn't miss this event. So, we made sure we found a spot in the front row. And what should I say? We were absolutely not disappointed. We experienced a concert that got under our skin and witnessed a musical sensation: the tenth anniversary of the 65daysofstatic album "Wild Light".**

When arriving at the venue, we first saved our "Wild Light" t-shirt with this fabulous artwork we'll never forget—then followed a drink in the comfortable seating area in the upstairs gallery, accompanied by an excellent panoramic view over the FC St. Pauli fan location. After that, it was finally time for the support act, Sugar Horse.

65daysofstatic had, of course, chosen their tour mates well. The opening of the stage by Sugar Horse was an extremely brilliant start. Not only did the singing have a mesmerising effect on us. The doomgaze band from Bristol convinced us all along the line and made a noticeable impression on the Hamburg audience. Suddenly, it was tranquil in the venue, and this devoted silence lasted until the end of the event—an honest compliment, which the Hanseatic city doesn't grant to every band.

Sugar Horse are often compared to giants like Oceansize or Mogwai. They have already collaborated with members of projects like Conjurer, Heriot, Conjurer, IDLES and Biffy Clyro (you can listen to what this sounds like, for example, on their EP "Waterloo Teeth", released on Small Pond in 2022).

## Unforgettable moments with 65daysofstatic 

So, the goosebumps were already well-prepared when 65daysofstatic stepped onto the planks in the darkness of Hamburg's scene district. An almost magical tension took hold of us and carried us away on a wave that we were allowed to surf for three hours straight. On top of their legendary long-player "Wild Light" tracks, 65daysofstatic shared another complete set with us. Here is the full set list for the evening:

1. HDIS
2. Prisms
3. The Undertow
4. Blackspots
5. Sleepwalk City
6. Taipei
7. Wild Light
8. Safe Passage
9. Debutante
10. Retreat
11. Arabic
12. Crash Tactics
13. Asimov
14. AOD
15. Radio Protector

The highlight was, of course, "Radio Protector". By this time, the audience had danced themselves into ecstasy. Everything took place free of time and space. We all became one and divided again to race towards the beach of soundscapes, with our heads scoured by the ocean of rhythms and melodies built up by this outstanding band we carry so deep in our hearts. Every day since we first heard them.

## Living room atmosphere @ Knust, Hamburg

Do you want to know my résumé? Despite the small location (or because of it?) with its living room atmosphere, 65daysofstatic's Hamburg was a pure delight—not only in terms of sound and atmosphere. 

> "This could be this year's greatest concert",

We already agreed on this after the first three songs and haven't changed our opinion yet. These guys from Sheffield are living and breathing music!

What happened on that stage was highly professional, perfectly tuned and yet filled with emotion, empathy and joy for music and the people who enjoy it—enriched with the right amount of interaction and humour at the right moment.

Thank you, 65daysofstatic! You have changed my year 2023 for the better—significantly!
