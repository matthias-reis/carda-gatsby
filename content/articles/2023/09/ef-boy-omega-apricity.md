**EF contacted me with a huge surprise this week. I felt pretty flattered when my favourite band asked me: "We have a new single ready. Would you like to take a pre-listen?" Yes, of course, I wanted that! The good news for you guys is that you can also listen to "Apricity" from today. Here are my thoughts about it so far:**

The Swedes recorded a summerlike, upbeat pop serenade with their good friend Martin Hasselgren, aka Boy Omega. The track, initially released on EF's newest album, "[We Salute You, You And You](/2022/11/ef-interview-en/)", now comes in an entirely different style of playing, contrasting with the original and suiting the song wonderfully.

The relaxed, cheerful mood underlines the otherwise rather pensive, gloomy nature of the band very well and adds fascinating new facets to their distinctive sound. I am already very curious to hear more of this. The new EF song makes me want more, and I would be happy to spend the dark, cold wintertime with more of these dreamy, colourful sound miracles.

"Apricity" lifts your mood and pushes away all those heavy, grey thoughts and dark rain clouds. EF and sound artist Boy Omega, who likes to mix field recordings with loops, Game Boy sounds, and classical strings for his songs made room for a new musical level—of the band's sound and the music world in general. It's a level between dreamgaze and post-rock and between summer and winter.

So maybe this piece of music is made for the winter months. It sounds like a derivative of summer with plenty of room for warmth, cosiness, and thoughts of the blooming meadows in June full of butterflies, strawberry cake and this light-hearted festival atmosphere we all cherish so deeply.

Listen to it. I love it already.
