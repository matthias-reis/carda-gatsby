**Oslo Tapes aka Marco Campitelli releases his new, now fourth album, "Staring At The Sun Before Goin‘ Blind," today. It is an exceptional work that comes just in time for the end of this year. They made it with Echodelick, Sound Effect, and Grazil Records. Besides the digital version, you can get your copy as an LP or CD.**

With "Staring At The Sun Before Goin' Blind", the project from Italy releases a very personal version of an acoustic mirage of disorientation and restlessness. The record is a successful mixture of post-, art-, kraut- and noise rock—as if made for our times of confusion and confusion. Here is what Marco said:

> "Staring at the Sun Before Goin' Blind' is hypothetically a brief period traversed in eight tracks, from the ethereal opening of 'Gravity' to the hypnotic 'Ethereal Song', the avant-syncretism of 'Deja Neu', and the psychedelic and modern deep house vibes of 'Reject Yr Regret'.
>
> It follows the harmonic framework of 'Like a Metamorphosis' in a fusion of psychedelic jazz, the post-minimalist fuzz-kraut of 'Middle Ground', the distorted and celestial 'Somnambulist's Daydream', and the tribal-kaleidoscopic title track finale."

Because this puts it into words so wonderfully, there's almost nothing more to say here than listen to this LP. You won't regret it!

## Imaginative arrangements and flowing basses

If you love the music of bands like God Is An Astronaut, Neu!, Can, Porno For Pyros, Nine Inch Nails and Angel Of Light, you'll probably already be familiar with Oslo Tapes. If not, you're welcome. Here's your newest brilliant discovery!

Staring at the Sun Before Goin' Blind" is the follow-up to the successful third Oslo Tapes album "ØR", which they released on Pelagic in 2021. The restlessness and disorientation mentioned above take hold of you as you listen and spread further and further as the playing time progresses. At the same time, curiosity grows as to what will develop next from the fireworks of metronomic rhythm patterns, flowing bass and melodically enraptured synths. The image of the mirage that Oslo Tapes chose to describe the record is more than fitting.

Ex-faUSt member Amaury Cambuzat produced the masterpiece with Ulan Bator, who wrote the songs and arrangements with Marco Campitelli. He used countless magnetic tapes and analogue machines to make the album sound perfect. You can definitely sense his thirty years in kraut and avant-garde rock when listening to the album.
