description: The bristol-based indie band Krooked Tongue just released their new EP "Deathproof". Get to know them in my interview!
excerpt: The Bristol-based indie band Krooked Tongue is currently on tour, presenting their new album, "Deathproof". It follows its predecessor, "No Vacancy Hotel", and the piece, "When The Beaches Bleed", which they also just released, very closely. After introducing the three quick-witted lads to you in my playlist for May, it's time for an interview now. Their relaxed festival sound is simply too beautiful not to dive deeper into it.

**The Bristol-based indie band Krooked Tongue is currently on tour, presenting their new album, "Deathproof". It follows its predecessor, "No Vacancy Hotel", and the piece, "When The Beaches Bleed", which they also just released, very closely. After introducing the three quick-witted lads to you in my playlist for May, it's time for an interview now. Their relaxed festival sound is simply too beautiful not to dive deeper into it.**

**Anne:** Hi! Thanks for taking the time! How are you doing these days?

**Krooked Tongue:** Hey, Anne! We're good! Thanks for having us! 

**Anne:** Congrats on your new EP "Deathproof"! What inspired you to write it?

**Krooked Tongue:** Ah, thank you! Well, I think it was just a perfect amount of time between our prior single "When the Beaches Bleed" to release something, and we had all these brand-new tunes that people had been crying out for at live shows. So, we thought it was only right we recorded them and bunched them into an EP. 

**Anne:** Your song that inspired me the most so far is "Backseat Therapy". Do you want to tell me the story behind it?

**Krooked Tongue:** Yeah! So, for "Backseat Therapy", the idea came from a taxi ride I was on in the city. There was loads of traffic, and the driver kept apologizing for the delay and, long story short, got into a rant about how he wanted to quit and hated dealing with people who took out their traffic frustrations on him. And I ended up being the mediator in the cab, hence "Backseat Therapy". 

**Anne:** You are on currently tour, presenting the songs on your new "Deathproof" EP. Are you also playing the songs from your brilliant debut, "No Vacancy Hotel"?

## "People show our music so much love"

**Krooked Tongue:** Yeah, So, we're in the middle of it currently, almost at the end of the UK side before we head to Estonia next weekend. For sure, we've been playing everything from 'No Vacancy Hotel' because people still show that EP so much love, so it's only fair to play them live!

**Anne:** Which gig on your tour are you looking forward to most?

**Krooked Tongue:** Well, we have Bristol this weekend. Our hometown shows are always so wild, so that will be wicked. But we're so excited about heading to Tallinn next week. That will be a truly amazing experience. 

**Anne:** Like you said, you're based in Bristol – a city that's home to many great artists, the wonderful ArcTanGent and many more great events. How would you describe the scene there? Why is it so flourishing, and what distinguishes Bristol from other UK and EU cities?

**Krooked Tongue:** Oh, there's definitely a great scene in Bristol, it harbours so much local music, but it's so varied. I think that's what makes the scene great, is that you can have bills with a variety of music and genres on, and it almost always usually works. 

**Anne:** You founded Krooked Tongue in 2022. I am sure there've been some other projects before. Do you want to name some of them?

**Krooked Tongue:** So we started prior to 2022, but with all the lockdowns and the sh⋆⋆, we only really had our first proper year in 2022. 

**Anne:** Do you have any favourites when it comes to bands, artists, and music in general?

## "Influences are important"

![Krooked Tongue](https://storage.googleapis.com/cardamonchai-media/2023-05-11/krooked-tongue-2-jpg-imagine-181818_323535_1024_768/640.webp "Krooked Tongue")

**Krooked Tongue:** There are way too many to name. But our go-to for the band's favourite is usually people like Highly Suspect, Death from Above, and Demob Happy. It's so important to take influence from everywhere you can, though.

**Anne:** You just mentioned it: After nearly three years filled with uncertainties due to COVID shutdowns and other unplanned circumstances, touring seems to become easier again for bands. I can imagine this quite releasing. I am sure you are enjoying this new, post-shutdown era?

**Krooked Tongue:** Yes, for sure! We've all been dying to get back into the live scene. Musicians and fans alike. There's an unsettling undertone to everything currently, but there is a glimmer of hope. The live shows are a gateway to a better future for the world of music. 

**Anne:** Your songs are about topics many people feel uncomfortable talking about. And you always manage to put it into music and words so easily, bringing it into the world in a straightforward and inspiring way. How do you manage to do that? Is it one of your motivations to spread the word in these dark, heavy and sometimes scary times?

**Krooked Tongue:** It's important to touch on a variety of topics, I think. Something you have to go into areas that are a bit more taboo, but that's the nature of art. It was always designed as a way to push back on norms. Something that maybe has been lost slightly over the last few years. 

**Anne:** So, would you describe Krooked Tongue as a political band?

## "We don't claim to be a political band"

![Krooked Tongue – "Deathproof"](https://storage.googleapis.com/cardamonchai-media/2023-05-11/krooked-tongue-death-proof-jpeg-imagine-080808_3b3839_4000_4000/640.webp "Krooked Tongue – "Deathproof"")

**Krooked Tongue:** Nah, we wouldn't describe ourselves as a political band,  even though we do discuss certain topics in that field from time to time. I think it just comes down to being able to know that nothing really ever changes with those in charge. These people don't give a fu⋆⋆ about the general population. So, if nothing else, be aware of that. It's us versus them, as much as they manipulate everyone into picking a side within themselves. 

**Anne:** So, after touring the UK you planning to visit the continent? Is there any chance to see you live on stage in Germany? Or are you going back to the studio after the last show?

**Krooked Tongue:** As we said earlier, we're heading to Estonia, but we'd love nothing more than to do a full tour of Europe. Our friends The Soap Girls recommended Germany to us, so we have to try to make that happen as soon as possible!

**Anne:** Once again, thanks for your time and for answering my questions! All the best for your tour!

**Krooked Tongue:** No worries at all. Thank you for having us. Have a great week.
