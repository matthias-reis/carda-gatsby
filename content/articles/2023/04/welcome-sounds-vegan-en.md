**Today is a big one! I have something to celebrate that I've been preparing for months now. OK, I don't want to keep you guys on the rack. Here is the news: I've decided to rename my blog! So, say hello to Sounds Vegan! I promise you to stick to my topics—veganism and music—but with more style than ever before!**

In case you want to know the reasons I switched to Sounds Vegan, here is why:

First up, honestly, "Rock 'n' Roll" sounded tacky to me over time. I also always thought it reads a bit wobbly. The second, even bigger thing for me was that it didn't fit with my Domain name, cardamonchai.com—The name of my first-ever personal blog. And I grew out of that over the years. And there is another reason: The term "Rock 'n' Roll" doesn't really fit the music genres I write about mostly: post-rock, post-metal, post-hardcore, ambient, DIY and all those doomy, gloomy types of heavy, alternative, and indie music.

Of course, all those genres have their origins, but so did rock 'n' roll. And, unlike some people who made rock 'n' roll a big deal: I don't want to ignore them!

## Sounds Vegan doesn't only sound better!

Anyhow: It's time for a different chapter, a new era and a little glow-up! Sounds Vegan is now my website and your hub for everything that sounds and tastes good!

Your feedback and my personal impression have also convinced me that the name Rock 'n' Roll vegan can lead to confusion sometimes. As you probably know, my blog has nothing to do with petty coats, rock 'n' roll dancing, lowriders, quiffs or anything rockabilly. And I have no contact with this world either.

I feel like I made the right decision. I think Sounds Vegan it is the perfect fit because when you read through the articles on my site, at some point, you will always find stories about animal rights, vegetables, and climate change—alongside all the music.

And did you know actual vegan sounds are also a topic that is getting bigger and bigger? More and more artists I do interviews with tell me they are vegans as well! It's wonderful, isn't it? The change is happening!

Of course, not all the members of the bands I present on page my are vegans. But I don't have that claim either. For me, it's all about inspiring people and sharing my discoveries with you. I know I can do that by writing about two topics closest to my heart: Music and veganism. Sounds Vegan pretty much sums that up, don't you think? Also: If I decide to write about classical music or singing vegan chefs, I can still keep on using Sounds Vegan!

So, now you know why things have been a bit quiet here over the last weeks. Behind the scenes, there's been a lot going on—including several technical adjustments and the design of the brand-new logo you can find on my homepage now—thank you, Matze, for your incredible work and support and for always being there for me—no matter what!

Thanks also to all of you readers of my page for sharing your music with me and for always keeping the conversation about the most important things (besides my dear ones) in my life running. You are awesome!

So, sign up for my newsletter if you haven't already, [meet me on the socials](https://linktr.ee/soundsvegan) and feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:info@soundsvegan.com) whenever you want to share an idea with me, if I should interview you and your band or project or write a story about your NGO or your vegan and cruelty-free product.
