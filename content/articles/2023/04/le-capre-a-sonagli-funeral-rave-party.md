**"Funeral Rave Party" doesn't just sound like the essence of the two musical styles that probably inspired me the most in the early 2,000s. It's the name of the first EP with English lyrics by the Italian psychedelic band Le Capre A Sonagli.**

After enjoying some advanced education in sound engineering and production after their last recording, the artists produced their newest record entirely by themselves. Their goal was to shape everything with their own hands, to rediscover the universe and its complexity in physics and numbers. And it seems their experiment led them to success.

For the band, "Funeral Rave Party" is one thing above all: a psychedelic-rhythmic ritual. You could play it at an alternative festival as well as at an underground techno party. The whole thing sounds like something out of a horror movie. Capre A Sonagli drew some of their inspiration from the art of filmmaker Cronenberg –  I think they clearly reached that goal, too.

## A psychedelic journey alongside river Styx

![Le Capre A Sonagli – "Funeral Rave Party" EP cover (A dark, abstract, AI-generated picture showing four humans standing in the middle of two trees)](https://storage.googleapis.com/cardamonchai-media/2023-04-21/le-capre-a-sonagli-1-jpg-imagine-080808_151208_800_800/640.webp "Le Capre A Sonagli – \"Funeral Rave Party\"")

With their songs, they follow the currents of the river Styx through the dark of the abyss, telling stories from their nightmares. So the band name (en: "rattlesnake goats") fits perfectly into this world.

The band already revealed the following secret about the record:

> "'Funeral Rave Party' is the first volume of a larger body of work whose stylistic code rests on the foundation of doubt and deception, lenses through which to view the entire sonic world of Le Capre A Sonagli."

So the scary movie continues! In the meantime, to build up our tension to infinity, we can listen to Le Capre A Sonagli's gripping soundtrack to the apocalypse. That's precisely how "Funeral Rave Party" sounds to me. Darkness subtly embedded into a psychedelic sea of sounds and musical excess.

The sound experience starts with an "Overture" of a special kind. The theme of the song is Virgil from the divine "Capresque" ("Goatesque") comedy. Bass and drums pave a winding path full of imaginative mythical creatures whose faces emerge from the fog of the underworld song by song.

The second song, "Funeral Rave Party", is the EP's eponymous and central track. The exciting and dark atmosphere peaks here, mixing with harmonic, playful world music elements before the song once again develops into the direction of mystical and psychedelic chasms.

## The soundtrack for the apocalypse

Before the final chord, "Exit" sets another rave-like statement. The band intends the track as a tribute to the spontaneous and alternative expression of raves:

> "We chopped up our acoustic sounds and got a dirty, rhythmic, and wild electronic mass. Our goal is to encourage loss of self through redundancy and obsession to get you high with straight-kick drumming. Lose your ego!"

Le Capre A Sonagli officially formed on April 1st 2011, when they released their EP "Le Capre A Sonagli"—which they performed live on stage as an opening act for the Asian Dub Foundation.

In October 2012, the project released its first full-length album, which the music press liked a lot. Then, in April 2013, they reached the finals of Arezzo Wave, and in October 2013, they won the award in the category "best self-production" at the Italian independent music prize PIMI. 

At the beginning of summer 2014, Le Capre A Sonagli secluded themselves in the studio. When they came out again in March 2015, they had their album, "The Fauno", on which they combined blues and lo-fi with woozy dream sequences, ready to share with the world.

## A fresh start for Le Capre A Sonagli

After a restart from this point, numerous collaborations, performances, awards, and various other productions and sound experiments were awaiting them. Since 2017, Le Capre A Sonagli have been signed to the Italian indie label Woodworm, where they released their stoner-folk record "Cannibale" in March 2017.

After two subsequent years on tour, they released eight more tracks in March 2019 under the name "Garagara Yagi". It's the band's answer to what would happen if Gorillaz, C.C.C.P. and QOTSA were on stage together.

Le Capre A Sonagli released their EP "Funeral Rave Party" at the end of March. It's available on all music platforms.

In case you've been wondering: The band uses AI-created images for their artworks. I think it's another proof not everything about this scary futuristic stuff leads to something bad, don't you think?
