**With "Infinite Heights", MMTH set new standards in terms of sound. They invite us on a versatile road trip into the infinite mountains of resonance and the depths of guitar walls—including tremolo and cinematic moments.**

If ethereal shoegaze sound is your dearest souvenir from the 1980s, and you enjoy heaviness and playfulness in the form of instrumental experiments, you should give MMTH a chance. The new album by the Aurich-based post-music project is of brute beauty—it lives from its well-considered progressiveness. What I mean by that is that the six tracks don't get lost in krautrocky fiddling or stodginess. MMTH understand how to place accents and hints—always at the right moment.

Bernd Frikke, Carlo Persh, Hanno Jansen and Jan R. Haneborger will release their latest sonic masterpiece on November 17th. The first two singles are already available, so you can get a taste of what's to come below. If you listen to it in one go, however, the album develops its full scope, and you can savour the moving story in all its beauty. Please don't miss out on this experience! The two years in the studio have been worth it.

The press compares MMTH with projects like Tides from Nebula, Long Distance Calling or Slowdive. Following their 2017 album "Paternoster", they gained extensive stage experience with Rosetta, Public Service, Broadcasting, Hemelbestormer, Coastlands, The Clouds Will Clear and Spoiwo, among others.

## "Infinite Heights" by MMTH – 31 minutes that make you want more

In just 31 minutes, MMTH burn themselves into your memory with "Infinite Heights". The desire to listen to the record all over again quickly manifests. This may partly be caused by the band's excellent rhythm work, as well as by their experimental but unpretentious style of playing. Everything's perfectly coordinated and well-composed. The occasionally appearing heavy riffs make you want more. The band also placed them very well, driving the flywheel on and on. You will probably also notice the exciting synth layers—they must be a real treat in live shows!

If you like cinematic sounds, you will likely enjoy the penultimate track on the record, "Dark Sun". The transition to the last piece, "Sampras", is also pleasantly well-rounded. Please let the band continue playing at this point during live shows. Enjoy their play in silence and save your frenetic applause for after the final chord! I promise it will be even greater once you've heard the album's grand finale in full bloom.

MMTH self-produced "Infinite Height" completely. Drummer Hanno did the mixing and engineering at Dickfehler Studios in Aurich. Film composer Eike Ebbel Groenewold took care of the final mastering at Klangfeld Studios. Christian Bardenhorst created the artwork, to which bassist Bernd contributed some photos.
