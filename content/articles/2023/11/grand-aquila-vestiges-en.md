**Grand Aquila are celebrating the release of their new album "Vestiges" today. Dynamic post-metal full of captivating transitions, harmonies, and intensity awaits you. The quartet from Belgium knows how to impress with a debut album, making room for an adventurous departure.**

Grand Aquila recorded "Vestiges", which means "remains" or "ruins", between 2021 and 2022 with none other than Tobias Stieler from Kokomo! The whole thing was released digitally and as a vinyl version on Dunk!

The album thrives on its exciting contrasts and breaks. The second track, "Concarnatio", for example, starts off almost punky but then quickly catches itself and breaks out into branching post-metal worlds. Darkness alternates with lightness, hardness with warmth. The shoegazers among you should be just as thrilled here as many a prog fan.

## Grand Aquila defying boundaries

![Grand Aquila – "Vestiges"](https://storage.googleapis.com/cardamonchai-media/2023-11-03/grand-aquila-vestiges-2-png-imagine-181818_423a32_1024_768/640.webp 'Grand Aquila – "Vestiges"')

Grand Aquila have created extensive soundscapes in which you can enjoy getting lost. It is the perfect escapism for a rainy Saturday afternoon and the soundtrack for life in the gray areas.

Even if the overall atmosphere is rather somber, there still lies plenty of hope in this partly instrumental, partly screamed and sung masterpiece. You can hear it flashing out here and there between the walls of guitars and elaborately structured passages.

The band used unusual instruments such as melodica, French horn, and Waldorf Blofeld for the six tracks. They also sampled sounds such as crumpling paper, plastic bags, and some rusty door hinges and added them to their compositions. Have a listen and see if you can spot them!

Dunk!records describes "Vestiges" like this:

> "Grand Aquila is more than a band; they're architects of a sonic journey. Get ready to embark on a musical adventure that defies boundaries"

With this, you also have my clear recommendation. If you want to listen to Grand Aquila defying boundaries, their record is available everywhere from today.
