**I recently got to know the Berlin post-rock band Ausklang through From Overseas founder and Past Inside The Present label manager Kévin Séry. I liked their music so much that I invited them for an interview.**

Ausklang - what sounds like the perfect end to a fulfilling day in German is an upcoming music project consisting of Fabian (guitar, synth), Benjamin (drums, tape loops) and Simon (bass/synth/piano).

**Anne:** Hi! Thanks for taking the time for this interview! How is the mood in Berlin?

**Fabian:** Hello Anne! Thanks for asking! Everybody is doing fine!

**Anne:** You've just finished recording your first album "Chronos" - it will be released on September 4th. Are you excited?

**Benjamin:**  Quite a bit! We are really happy that it will finally "be born".

**Anne:** How were the recordings? Did you have fun?

**Simon:** The recordings rocked! We had the opportunity to record in a studio where artists like Nils Frahm and Efterklang had already recorded before us. That was very inspiring!

**Anne:** How long did it take you to write and record "Chronos"?

**Fabian:** We did the recording session in a few days, but until the mixing and mastering were finished, another four months passed. I think good music always needs enough time to mature.

**Anne:** I love to find out the story behind an album. Sometimes you listen to music with completely different ears when you know it. Does your new record have a special theme?

## "We already know how our next album will be called"

**Fabian:** It's a fascinating fact that the Greek language has two terms for the word "time": "Chronos" stands for the passing of time, the ticking of seconds, minutes, hours, in other words chronologically. "Kairos", on the other hand, stands for the time lived. The here and now. That's what our next album will be called.

**Anne:** So far you have released four singles and one EP. Am I right? Is an album some kind of a new level?

**Benjamin:** Absolutely! The singles were already a foretaste, but the album is putting it all together.

**Anne:** How long have you been around? Did you make music before? If yes: Has ist always been Ambient/Post-Rock?

**Fabian:** We founded the band about one year ago. Before that, every one of us had already played in several bands - mostly alternative rock and stuff like that. In the end, our passion for ambient and post-rock brought us together.

## "Like looking at the open sea"

**Anne:** Our love for atmospheric guitar sound unites us. What do you think is so fascinating about it?

**Fabian:** I always connect the feeling of width with this sound. It's extremely long reverberation brings is what brings it to life. It's like when you look at the open sea or the starry sky at night.

**Anne:** You recorded your video for the second pre-release "Aufbruch" in a prison in Berlin Köpenick. This sounds brilliant to me. The mood is quite dark. How was it to shoot there?

**Simon:** This prison is truly a very strong place. It is oppressive there on one hand. On the other hand, the architecture is totally inspiring. We knew the place through Jail Sessions. That's an art project where musicians are playing in the inmate's cells.

**Anne:** You are based in Berlin. How would you describe the post-rock scene there?

**Benjamin:** There are many talented young bands in Berlin. The problem is that it seems to be harder to stay in touch in a big city.

We have a good connection to the Duo Ceeys (Contemporary) from Potsdam and will play our record release concert on September, 9th at the Zionskirche in Berlin.

**Anne:** Will there be a tour in 2021? Will we meet you at festivals?

## Concerts in planetariums

**Fabian:** We are currently organizing a tour where we will play exclusively in old churches, factory halls, and planetariums. These places harmonize perfectly with our music. If you know such a place near you, please let us know! We are also planning to play at some festivals like SlotArt in Poland.

**Anne:** Which musicians would you describe as your main influences?

**Benjamin:** We love Icelandic bands like Sigur Rós and post-rock groups like pg.lost and Minor Movements. These bands have had a huge influence on our sound. Hammock are our absolute ambient heroes.

**Anne:** How would you describe the collaboration with Past Inside The Present?

## "Chronos" will also be released on vinyl

**Fabian:** We are super happy about the cooperation with the label, which is always very open and personal. Above all, we are happy that "Chronos" will be released there on vinyl. This wasn't planned at all in the beginning and therefore we are even happier.

**Anne:** What's next for Ausklang?

**Fabian:** We would like to make more records in any case. "Chronos" is just the beginning. Most of all, we want to play more live concerts and thereby get more people interested in our music.

Ausklang are in love with atmospheric, ambient-inspired post-rock. The second single release from the new record "Chronos" is called "Aufbruch". The official video is absolutely worth watching.
