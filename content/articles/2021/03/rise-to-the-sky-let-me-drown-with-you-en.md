**Rise to the Sky is a one-person doom metal project from Santiago, Chile. Singer Sergio founded the band in 2019 with the release of his first album "Moonlight". Now his new record "Let Me Drown With You" is out.**

Sergio's first LP was a musical rollercoaster of emotions. He played with different atmospheres and sudden changes to plain screaming, which is characteristic of his own personal style of making music.

His EP "In the Grave of a Forgotten Soul", with which he finally cemented his place in atmospheric doom metal, followed in June 2020.

## "Let Me Drown With You" is the third album from Rise to the Sky.

Hardly anyone in the metal biz is as productive as Rise to the Sky. A few days after the EP was out, the second LP, "Death Will not Keep Us Apart", followed on 9 October – the second one Sergio released on the Russian label GS Productions. The EP, "A Cold Embrace from Life", came out shortly after (December), and now on 12 March, his third album "Let Me Drown With You".   About his new record, Sergio says:

> "I released the album in loving memory of my father, who passed away suddenly and unexpectedly on 6 January 2021. His passions were the people he loved and everything he did. These songs are a clear reflection of our way of life for me. 'Let Me Drown With You' is by far the most sincere and expressive record Rise to the Sky by now. My sound has evolved and matured. So expect strong emotions."

The heralded emotions are on the album as much as his typical clear shouts, hard riffs and sudden changes. Sergio expresses the gloomy mood of our time of fear and isolation and his grief for his beloved father. With a total of nine songs, he delivers a great work that will hopefully soon be running up and down the metal festivals of this world. Listen to it. It's worth it.
