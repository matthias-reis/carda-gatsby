**Willebrant has a new EP out! "The Pilgrim" is about the journey of someone setting out on an adventure. The record is inspired by "El Camino de Santiago". A deep sound bath full of surprises awaits you.**

The Australian sound artist himself describes his new record like this:

> "A sound tunnel to the soul of pilgrimage. They say that el Camino calls you; perhaps this is the beginning of the trail."

To me, this sounds not only mystical but also pretty exciting. After a year or so without the open, clear view of the horizon, I would love a proper journey.

I put on my headphones and start my adventure with a dive. I let myself slide down into the cool water and, at the same time, tune into the sound of the deep, which gradually reveals its face before my inner eye.

The sounds, which pass unnoticed into the second track, "Trail", are harmonious, ethereal and fragile. I keep on sinking into the ocean. The world that surrounds me becomes a little stonier and steeper now. A bell accompanies me and guides me through the unknown terrain.

It feels meditative – relaxed, and powerful at the same time. Then, finally, the bell wakes me up, and I start swimming back up - very slowly, without any hurry. "Ascending" accompanies me on my way up, and I realise how deep I have dived into this reef of diverse sounds.

I swim past corals and see colourful fish swimming away from me. The light above my head gets brighter and brighter – until brake the surface with my head. A flock of birds awaits me.

The fourth piece, "The Pilgrim", also begins unnoticed. I put down my equipment and stride through the long grass towards the forest. The air is warm and full of scents. I choose a path that winds its way up a hill.

The music surrounds me – minimalist, subtle and peaceful. The finale is called "Plateau (Into The Valley)". I sit on a stone that is warmed by the sun and let my gaze wander. From here, I can see the whole valley and the bay where I have been diving; the birds who are still circling above the beach, the lush green of the untouched forest, and even some of the fish in the ocean that looks quite turquoise from up here. 

I set off again to continue walking across a meadow into a light-flooded grove. I can sense some white noise now. It must be the leaves that are fluttering in the wind.

Willebrant's new EP already made it to my list of "most beautiful ambient records of the year". So if you also would love to go on a sound journey, I can highly recommend it to you.
