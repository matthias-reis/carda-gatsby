**Anne:** Congrats on your new album "Do No Harm"! How long did it take you to record it?

**Dani:** Approximately three years worth of material, some newer than the others!

**Anne:** Did you record it on your own, or was there anyone who helped with the pre-/recording/mixing/mastering.

**Dani:** I am the sole person responsible for all of the pre-/recording/mixing and mastering!

**Anne:** What's the story behind "Do No Harm"?

**Dani:** It's the tale of my life. The story it tells is about our present, our past, our future, but most of all, right at this very moment. I believe it tells the story of many.

**Anne:** So the album mirrors the current phase of your life and the world?

**Dani:** Yes, absolutely! It's very symbolic of my current phase, and I also believe it accurately represents the world.

**Anne:** How are you doing these days? The last time we talked, you told me you had been struggling. But, the previous posts I read from you were all pretty positive. That's so good to hear if you think of the tough times we all kind of went through within the last months. It always lifts my mood when I read stories about people enjoying their lives to the fullest. Are you doing better? What changed?

**Dani:** I am doing much better these days and feel life is on an uphill climb for me. I am much more positive of a person, I would say, despite the daily struggles with mental illness. I've dealt with mental illness my whole life, but it seemed to get worse in my twenties. It can be very debilitating: but I try not to let fear dictate my reality anymore.
I feel I have come a long way.

This Summer, Nature led me to an all-encompassing Goddess; I just had not realized it right away. As a result, I feel like a changed person, I feel like a better person, and my life is better.

I am not sure where I would be without Nature to guide me this year. But, I know "Do No Harm" would not exist.

**Anne:** Thank you so much for opening your heart and speaking so openly about these topics! This means a lot! 

Is there anything else about the album I shouldn't miss? Do you have a favourite song on the record?

**Dani:** Thank you so much for the opportunity! It means so much to me!

The message of my album is to **do no harm** to others and yourself. And those are the life values that I try to uphold.

My favourite track is definitely "The Only Thing Left" It is the last track on the album as I feel the lyrics at the end send a powerful message: "Here I stand: No! Here I stand. The Spirit's alive – I couldn't believe it! I always believe the worst! The only the left the Goddess is here!" This message means everything to me.

**Anne:** Vielen Dank für Deine Antworten und natürlich für das wunderbare neue Album! Ich wünsche Dir viel Erfolg damit!

**Dani:** Danke, dass Du mir die Möglichkeit gibst, mein Album ins Rampenlicht zu stellen. Für mich ist diese Veröffentlichung das Wichtigste, was ich jemals erreicht habe.
