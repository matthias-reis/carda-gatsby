**On September 3rd, there will be an album release that you really can look forward to. The Flying Raclettes extends Luc Hess's and Jona Nido's instrumental duo Closet Disco Queen. You may probably know the two from their work with The Ocean, Coilguns, Louis Jucker and other projects.**

Live and studio sound engineer Kevin Galland, who also played with Coilguns and Chadi Messmer (bass), joined the band. So Closet Disco Queen became Closet Disco & The Flying Raclettes for this record. And hopefully some more? Let's see what awaits us.

## Closet Disco Queen look back on exciting stories

Closet Disco Queen formed in 2014 during a quiet period with Coilguns. Their stated goal at that time was: to become a less talented version of The Mars Volta.

In the meantime, Luc and Jona look back on three years full of exciting tour stories, two studio albums, two EPs, and two live albums. They have travelled the world together and played the stages as support for bands like Baroness and Red Fang.

A special highlight on their way must have been their performance at the Berlin-based Desert Fest. Closet Disco Queen have also toured various festivals in Switzerland. It was one sunny day at the Palp Festival when the Flying Raclettes were born.

## "Omelette du Fromage" is a homage to "Dexter's Laboratory".

The joint venture comes with the spicy title "Omelette du Fromage". It will be released on Jona Nido's record label Hummus Records. The album title is meant as a homage to the episode "The Big Cheese" of the 1996 Cartoon Network animated series "Dexter's Laboratory".

Dexter makes public speeches in the episode and eventually becomes a star by saying, "Omelette du Fromage". By their admission, the band plans to achieve fame across the universe with this excellent record, which they've enhanced with a hard-to-digest graphic design.

## A powerful piece of music

Whether Closet Disco Queen & The Flying Raclettes are as shady as Dexter in the Big Cheese episode is for fans to decide for themselves. 

I've already had the chance to listen to it in its entirety, and I'm pretty sure that this is not the case. The record is overall a colourful bouquet of great playful sound that blows up all of these tiny little boxes we like to put music into.

The additional bass and guitar have made the sound even more multi-layered compared to the last album, which also was extremely exciting. 

## Progressive elements and punk attitude

The band combines elements from the progressive psych and stoner world with rough punk attitude and sheer inexhaustible power, which we love so much from groups like The Mars Volta, Goat or The Hives.

The four wrote, recorded and mixed their album in only two weeks in the Swiss studio Mecanique. Exactly that means: the band got access to an abandoned school in the tiny mountain village of Bruson, where they set up a mobile studio and made an album that was sent to the pressing plant just 15 days later.

"Omelette du Fromage" is a power package without excuses. You can feel the fun the musicians must have had during their recording sessions in every note. When listening to it, you can finally forget all the nonsense flying around our ears these days. Please enjoy!
