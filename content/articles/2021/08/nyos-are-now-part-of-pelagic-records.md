**I just got some excellent news from Pelagic Records: The Finnish instrumental duo Nyos has now signed with the Berlin-based post-music label. Also, Nyos announced the release of their fifth album for next spring.**

While we wait for it, we can spend our time listening to their previous records. It's pretty much worth it to explore the band's discography in detail. It's good to know that vinyl versions of "Nature" (2016) and "Now" (2019) are now available at Pelagic Records.

## Nyos bounded over coffee and noise

The two albums reflect the band's musical evolution, showing influences ranging from math-rock to post-rock to noise. Guitarist Tom Brooke and drummer Tuomas Kainulainen love to work with loops and drone sounds, weaving numerous layers of keys and samples. Their energetic and imaginative use of drums adds the perfect contrast to this setup.

Tuomas and Tom formed Nyos in 2014 when the Finn and the Brit met shortly after Tom's move to Finland. Through their sincere admiration for noise bands, coffee and concerts, they immediately felt a strong connection. They self-released their first 26-minutes one-track piece that winter. Since 2015, the two have constantly been on tour – they have already played 200 concerts in more than 20 countries.

Their second album, "Nature", followed in 2016. Nyos recorded their two first albums at Tonhaven Studio and released their works on CD, LP and cassette. Their third album, "Navigation", came out in September 2017. 
It is a cooperation with the Karlsruhe-based label Meta Matter Records. Just like the first two records, Tom did the mixing for "Navigation". Mandy Parnell, who you might know from Sigur Rós, Aphex Twin, and Björk, did the mastering.

As their kick-off at Pelagic Records, Tom and Tuomas present a video version of their song "Nature" from 2016. Please check it out –  it is definitely worth watching. The clip shows pictures of different wild animals in their natural habitats in black and white. The images combine perfectly with the varied and diverse sound of the band from Jyväskylä. Btw: The [post-rock band Baulta](/2021/03/baulta-interview/) is also based in this area.
