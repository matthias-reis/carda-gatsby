**Psychedelic shoegaze sound with a strong woman on the microphone – If this is your cup of tea, you should definitely carry on reading. Horte's new album is so much more than just this. Here are all the details about it.**

"Maa antaa yon vaientaa" is the name of the record. In English, it means something like "Land Lets the Night Grow Silent", but what exactly Horte want to tell us remains their secret.

## Horte invite you into their world of sound

By the way, singer Riikka recorded all lyrics in Finnish. But that doesn't matter at all to those of us who don't understand this beautiful language. The important thing is the feelings that Horte convey, and they are tremendous – I promise you that.

![Horte – "Maa antaa yon vaientaa"](https://storage.googleapis.com/cardamonchai-media/2021-11-20/horte-horte-maa-antaa-yon-vaientaa-jpeg-imagine-787878_696f73_440_440/640.webp "Horte – \\\"Maa antaa yon vaientaa\\\"")

The total of seven songs is very tricky to put into words. Distorted soundscapes and dreamlike synthy sequences tell of a world that stands above things – worn and casual at the same time, without unnecessary ornaments and kitsch, but definitely multi-layered.

I was especially impressed by the field recordings and the dark electronic moments are also really quite something. Riikka says:

> "Our way is to work with the material as long as it takes for the piece to figure itself out. Sound comes with it. There is always a compositional vision of how the pieces should sound in a broader sense."

So it's all about the overall picture created by the music. The individual band members are more in the background. Riikka thinks:

> "Our principal goal is to keep the focus on the music without highlighting us as individuals."

If that sounds exciting to you, you can listen to the album now; Pelagic Records put it out today. The band members recorded in their home studios and at Lievestuore and at Tonehaven. Juho Vanhanen (Oranssi Pazuzu) was involved in the production and Saku Tamminen (Sink, Dark Buddha Rising) mixed "Maa antaa yon vaientaa".
