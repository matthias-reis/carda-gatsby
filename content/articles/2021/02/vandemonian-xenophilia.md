**This Saturday, Vandemonian from Hamburg will release their long-awaited debut album "Xenophilia". Progressive, political post-rock with cinematic touches awaits you.**

As a fan of bands like pg.lost, [Caspian](/2015/11/caspian-live-hafenklang-hamburg/), [God Is An Astronaut](/2021/02/god-is-an-astronaut-ghost-tapes-10-review/), and [We Lost The Sea](/2021/01/we-lost-the-sea-interview/), the three have, of course, hit a nerve with me with their progressive style. That's why I couldn't miss the album when I got the offer to listen to it some days ago. I want to recommend it to you as well now.

"Xenophilia" was written in a confusing phase of humanity that none of us had foreseen. In a way, you can hear that on the record. Everyone knows that an uncertain view of the future can lead to unexpected creativity. Whether this effect makes Vandemonian so strong is not known, but in any case, the Hanseatic band's sound is worth listening to - a successful debut. So much for now.

## Vandemonian from Hamburg deliver music from the future

Turbulent times bring turbulent music. So far, so good. But Vandemonian don't let themselves be dragged down by political disagreements, never-ending lockdowns and chaos in general. They deliver music from the future out of the worldwide madness - nonchalant, unimpressed and highly original.

Guitarist and singer Nick Braren and his fellow musicians recorded and produced the album between the end of 2018 and 2020 – on their own. Nick was able to contribute his experience in the audio field. The DIY approach allowed the band to live out their creative freedom fully. However, it was not for this reason that a few days went by between the plan to release a record and day X. This was primarily due to their involvement in other projects and professional commitments. But it is not like that: What takes a long time to mature becomes right in the end? You can definitely say that about "Xenophilia". But hopefully, Vandemonian have not reached their end. I would like to hear a lot more from this direction in the future, please!

## A musical maelstrom

The eight tracks' solid guitar base comes from Nick Braren's skilled talent and skills. One thing is for sure: The Australian knows how to handle his instrument. Drummer Alexander Benthin sets the precise clockwork with his drums. Dynamic song structures and well-calculated rhythm play put you in a good mood. Here is what Nick says about the album:

> "'Xenophilia' is not about fear. It is about progress. We must move forward and embrace the unknown. It is a chance to learn, to grow and to give. In a brave new world, there can be no fear. We cannot claim to know the truth and ban others from voicing their concern and we cannot continue to be divided because we cannot fail to accept that we are one. We are all the same."

The first song, "Robot", pulls me right into a vortex that I don't want to get out of. Vandemonian know how to lead fans of the more exciting music genres on the right track.

## Nodding my head in front of the stage of a smoky club

On the second track, "Spherical Development", the name says it all. It starts with chromatic guitar playing, then surprises with vocals. So the record is not entirely instrumental, as you might have suspected with this style of music. A touch of rehearsal room resonates in this song – in the right way.

In "Razumikhin", the band strikes thoughtful notes. The song jumps from being carried to being full of energy. The idea works. I wish myself into a smoky club. Head nodding in front of the stage. A beautiful picture that Vandemonian paint in my head.

During the next piece, "Jack Ketch", I can hold on to it for a moment. Then I drift off into another world – a world of thoughts drifting in the wind. I particularly like the vocals in this song.

"National Insecurity" – what a title. It is a song that tells of uncertainty, insecurity and the boundless greed and ignorance of some people in power. The rhythm is stirring. In the background, you can hear Edward Snowdon's voice. A healthy portion of anger resonates here, and it suits the Hanseatic people well. The powerful riffs ground the piece.

## Playful sounds and political lyrics

"Excommunication" begins in a typically light and harmonic post-rock style, only to break into playful sounds. Drums are kicking in. The song has surprises in store with the use of piano and tempo changes. A dramatic peak is followed by an abrupt final chord, which increases the anticipation of the last two songs on the record a bit more.

The next song is about people without a backbone. I like the weird guitar sounds, and there are some post-punk
