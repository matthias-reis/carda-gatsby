**"We don't want you to Netflix &amp; chill. We want you to WaterBear and act!" - Lisa Rose, Head of Impact at the sustainability streaming service WaterBear, said yesterday at a digital conference.**

WaterBear is the antithesis to Netflix, Prime &amp; Co., showing footage from a wide range of activists and NGOs. The British start-up is still very young and already on the rise worldwide. There are now only a few countries left where the programme is not available.

At WaterBear, all the employees are passionate about their work, and you can see that. Lisa's descriptions are emotional, if not to say euphoric. And there is a reason for that. She is proud of what she does. Proud of being able to make a difference. And she does - every single day.

The streaming platform primarily targeting the younger generations. So sometimes an advertising campaign is played exclusively on TikTok. According to Lisa, the biggest challenge is to convince people who do not already pay attention to sustainability and try to counteract climate change with their behaviour.

## WaterBear offers you a large selection of films

With a lot of passion and sensitivity, the WaterBear team also manages to land with these people. No wonder: the app and the portal itself are so well designed that you are really looking forward to streaming somewhere else this weekend. And it's worth it. The content is of high quality, and the selection of film material is extensive. The palette ranges from indie films to elaborate high-tech productions.

Using storytelling to make a difference in the world is actually a brilliant idea, isn't it? In case you're now wondering what the whole thing costs: Anyone who has access to WaterBear in their country can use the service for free. All you have to do is create an account, and you're ready to go.

All content on the digital platform deals with the future of our planet. The films are about climate protection, biodiversity, species preservation, sustainability, animal rights, diversity and solidarity, including award-winning and inspiring works that call for participation.

The streaming feeling is very different at WaterBear. You don't lie on your sofa staring at the screen, and time passes meaninglessly. While watching, you have the feeling that you are doing something. Which is no wonder: you are educating yourself, get deep insights into the work of activists and scientists, and you get your entertainment along the way.

## Local reports and NGO campaigns

As a member, you decide for yourself what content you would like to see, when and how. There is no advertising on WaterBear, and the registration is pretty simple. You can stream directly on the net or via the mobile app (which, by the way, is incredibly well done).

As big documentary film fans, the founders of WaterBear focus on local reports, NGO campaigns, slow travel and sustainable products. If you have a story to tell yourself, you can always contact WaterBear: the team is always looking for new, exciting content.

WaterBear now works with over 80 organisations worldwide. Circle Economy, Greenpeace, Africa Parks, WWF, WCN, World Fairtrade Organization, Women4Oceans, Sea Shepherd, Amazon Watch, and the Jane Goodall Institute are just a few.

Incidentally, the platform is named after the tardigrade - also known as the water bear. The eight-legged animals, most of which are less than a millimetre long, look like teddy bears. Their habitat is the sea, where they particularly like to settle in moss cushions. A unique characteristic of the tardigrades is a death-like state in which they can survive extreme environmental conditions. Afterwards, they wake up and continue to live.
