**Mono will release their new album "Pilgrimage Of The Soul" on September 17th. The record is a real milestone of the ongoing music year. You definitely shouldn't miss it.**

There are so many releases at the moment I can hardly keep up with listening to them and, of course, recommending them to you guys. But this one is more than exceptional, so I need to do a review.

## "Pilgrimage Of The Soul" is a true ray of light

"Pilgrimage Of The Soul" by Mono is a real highlight. I have listened to the record about 15 times over the last few weeks, and I figure out new details constantly. Every time I put it on the songs fascinate me more.

I already presented the pre-released song, "Riptide", to you in the [August issue of my music list](/2021/08/playlist-september-2021/).  The piece is just a tiny stone within a giant colourful mosaic that couldn't be more fascinating.

"Pilgrimage Of The Soul" is the eleventh studio album by our beloved post-rock legends from Japan. The band recorded it during the darkest phase of the Corona pandemic. Back then, in the summer of 2020, there was no ray of light. We didn't even have a clue that there would be such thing as a vaccination. No one knew what would happen next. Mono created this ray of light for us by recording this album.

## Dreamlike music in stormy times

Overall, "Pilgrimage Of The Soul" is a bit stormier than its predecessor, "Nowhere Now Here", from 2019. You can't just sense that in the higher tempo of the songs, but also through the influences from the techno/electronic corner – By the way: Did I mention that my last rock concert before the crisis hit us all was a Mono gig where they performed these amazing songs? I will certainly never forget that evening. If I had known at that time what was in store for us, I would have enjoyed it even more. Do you think that would've been possible? Who knows.

"Pilgrimage Of The Soul" lives from its contrasts like everything I know from Mono. There is a lot of shadows, but also a lot of light, and I love that. Harmonies, disharmonies and pleasant phases of calm make the record an exciting rollercoaster ride of emotions that you won't want to leave again so quickly.

## Hypnotic and fascinating

I already told you about the opener "Riptide". It opens the door to the fantastic world of Mono. It starts with a hypnotic intro followed by a strong wall of hard drums, playful guitars and synthesizers. 

There is no time for a rest after the first track. "Imperfect Things" continues the search for light in a multi-layered way. Now it's time for the electronic elements I just told you about. They are like the golden glue in the porcelain that brings the work of art back to life – the beauty lies in imperfection. But, to be honest: The only thing that is really imperfect here is my amateurish try to describe this perfect song.

## A journey through time

The third track, "Heaven In A Wild Flower", takes me straight into the orchestra pit – tender moments are replaced by droning rhythm, only to wander away pensively. The transition to the next song feels almost meditative.

The journey through time continues classically with "To See A World" – what a great song. The next one, "Innocence", also picks me up right from the start. Here is what Mono said about it:

> "With 'Innocence', we wanted to express the splendour of living purely. Living with a magnificent dream in your heart, like an endless land and sky, is the joy of life and the reason you were born. Don't give up. Accept all the wounds and sadness, and continue chasing the dream."

It's beautiful, isn't it? "The Auguries" begins playfully. But wait, there is some tension. What is it that awaits us? The precise drums and the sensational play of rhythm and melodies are putting me under a spell. Layer upon layer unfolds a pompous sound jewel that could develop into a favourite song. Let's see. To me, it sounds like a collection of beautiful moments.

## "Hold Infinity In The Palm Of Your Hand" is the highlight of the album.

The highlight of the album is the track "Hold Infinity In The Palm Of Your Hand". For twelve and a half minutes, I watch the sands of time running through my fingers, see the rainforests shrink, the deserts expand, and the ocean sweeping the coasts away. The song is a monumental dream of humanity facing the abyss. Emotion resonates in every note.

"And Eternity In An Hour" rounds off the record and brings me back down to earth. The piano, synthesizers and wistful strings paint pictures of beautiful memories and a hopeful view of the future.

## The world of Mono

Mono formed in Tokyo in 1999. Back then, their role models were bands like [Mogwai](/2021/03/as-the-love-continues-mogwai-en) and My Bloody Valentine and great composers like Ennio Morricone and Beethoven. Today they are one of the best-known bands in the experimental sector and have long since carved out their own place in the music world with their diverse and extensive discography. In addition, they inspire millions with their fascinating soundscapes.

The contrasts on "Pilgrimage Of The Soul" reflect the last months in a very empathetic way – after anger comes hope, after sadness comes longing. 

Please listen to this album. I promise you won't regret it.
