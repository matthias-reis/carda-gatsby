**Von Mises from Cologne are making melodic post-rock. They rely on the classic band line-up consisting of rhythm and electronic section and guitar. On October 22nd, Jens, Mike, and Gunther released their first official album, "Ages".**

The total of eight tracks on "Ages" move back and forth between dramatic moments and silent sequences. Their concept album is an experiment with rock elements and synthy sounds for the band. The three of them succeed well in creating moving and diverse soundscapes out of it.

## Rock-solid post-rock

Overall the concept is a success – with only 40 minutes and 52 seconds. However, sometimes you just don't need more time to get to the point. What Von Mises are doing could be described as consistent post-rock – without any unnecessary frills or fancy flourishes. Nevertheless, something else resonates from it as well. The emotional component and the musicians' enchanting way of telling stories are captivating.

Voice samples give the listeners deep insights (e.g., you can hear a snippet from a speech by climate activist Greta Thunberg and an excerpt from Charly Chaplin's lyrics in the movie "The Great Dictator") – always making you curious about the next song. Not only that is indeed typical of the band's chosen genre. And Von Mises hardly deviate from this imagined "framework" in any other way either. But that doesn't matter, because the way they do it, they do it right. I think they could easily tour with bands like [We Lost The Sea](/2021/01/we-lost-the-sea-interview-en) or [Baulta](/2021/03/baulta-interview-en) – or even more. Let's see what the future has in store for them.

You can get "Ages" by Von Mises as CD, tape, or of course at all known online music services. I recommend you to listen to it – I can imagine your ears will love it.
