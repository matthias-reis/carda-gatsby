**Djiin recorded a record with Klonosphere and Season Of Mist – Because this sounds like we should give them a listen, I did that, and of course, I have put together all essential details about the album, that will be released by the end of this week for you.**

I have been following the development of Season Of Mist for quite some time now. In the meantime, some inspiring bands have found a home on the small label. One of them is Djiin. The quartet from Rennes, France, has been releasing music since 2017. Their latest work, "Meandering Soul", definitely deserves our attention.

## Prog meets Stoner Rock

Usually, you won't find much classical music like 1970s-influenced prog on my blog. However, for Djiin, this music style seems to be the basis, but they mix it with hard-to-digest, psychedelic stoner rock, something in the kraut direction, and doom. And that's where it gets interesting for me again. 

If you feel like discovering a colourful and, at the same time, dark potpourri, you might enjoy this band. The four name the early Black Sabbath as role models – yet they don't do without some modern references on their LP. Anyhow: Why should you put everything into genre boxes? At some point, the floors between give way anyway, and everything mixes. And that's how music works best in the end, doesn't it?

Djiin, that's bassist Charlélie Pailhes, drummer Allan Guyomard, guitarist Tom Penaguin, and singer and harpist Chloé Panhaleux, who holds everything together with her powerful voice.

## Djiin have a unique sound

"Meandering Soul" is the band's third album. Justin Nicquevert from The Blue Anvil Sound did the sound engineering, Pierre Le Gac, and Nicolas Moreau from Le Garage Hermétique mixed it.

There is a total of six songs on the record – my favourite so far is the opener "Black Circus". Psychedelic melodies and great vocals follow distorted riffs and heavy beats. So there is no chance of getting bored at any time. In addition, Chloé's electric harp provides a unique sound that sets the band apart from others within their niche.
