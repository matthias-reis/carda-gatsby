**The songs on the new Lower Automation album go by names like "Vegan Neuroscientist" and "Locust Bean Gum". It is somehow clear that this makes me more than curious. It seems to be a brilliant coincidence that I am also into it since the first listening.**

It's been three years since the noise/math-rock band from Chicago released their critically acclaimed EP "Shoebox Companion". Now the time for new success promising music from Lower Automation has finally come.

## "We wanted to sound the album like a panic attack"

There are ten tracks on the new record – ten tracks that enrich the musical landscape. The innovative mix of mathcore, noise, punk and metal elements emits sparks. It comes to mind that it must have been forged pretty hot, though (Btw: You can find a sample of the band's music at the end of my review).

The three deserve applause and at least to be mentioned here. I can highly recommend the self-titled album "Lower Automation" to you. The trio recorded their first full-length album with Zegema Beach Records. If you listen to the result, you can assume an extremely fruitful collaboration.

## "The weirdest possible record"

The band members themselves have the following to say about the record:

> "We wanted to make the weirdest album we could. In late 2019 we started throwing ideas around and ended up with 12 or so demos. Once we were in quarantine, we would have long phone conversations where we would dismantle and reassemble the songs in different ways. This music is a big departure from our last couple EPs. We let ourselves riff a little more off the cuff. In August of 2020, we spent five days recording the album ourselves in a cabin in the middle of nowhere in Michigan. It was hot and claustrophobic, perfect for an album that sounds like a panic attack."

With "Lower Automation", the Chicagoans live up to their previously suspected potential. The three of them are casually combining chaotic-seeming, wild math-rock that we are familiar with from bands like Dillinger Escape Plan and At The Drive-In with crass noise rock that comes with exciting no wave moments. I still have to take a closer look at the vegan hints here and there. I'll let you know as soon as I've found out what it's all about.

"Lower Automation" is hardcore, chilled, energetic, fantastic and pleasantly messy. And at the same time, as straightforward as music can be. So my recommendation for you is: Listen to it as soon as it is available!

As promised: Here is the audio sample I've picked for you. The song "Father's Shirt Is A Dress On Me" is not part of the new album, but it seemed to be an excellent foretaste. The single was released in April 2020.
