**Thot are celebrating the 10th anniversary of their milestone album "Obscured by the Wind" with a breathtaking live recording of their song "Blue & Green (are melting down in a new seed)". The video is available online now.**

Thot are announcing today's release with some bitterness: Due to some technical issues during the post-production of the recording, a large part of the material got destroyed. Originally the Brussels based band had planned open-air live versions of all ten songs on the record.

## Dreamlike atmosphere

What remains is a dreamlike version of the sixth song on the record "Blue & Green (are melting down in a new seed)". The massive amount of expression, pureness and feeling Grégoire and his group put into the atmospheric set leave you speechless.

Beautiful moments await you. The unique atmosphere, the natural dynamics, and the minimalist setup put a cosy veil over this outstanding work. The new arrangement is a particularly profound version of the great song. Grégoire describes Thot's characteristic style as "Vegetal Noise". There is truly no better way to describe this sound, which seems to come from another world.

Here is Grégoire's quote on the song:

> "'Blue & Green' is the most electronic track on the album 'Obscured by the Wind'. Taking possession of it in this uncluttered form was an intense exercise, which took on its full meaning thanks to the subtle playing of Lucie and the shivering violin of Catherine, on which I was able to lean. The full moon of spring was an ideal companion to celebrate the ten years of this album with this video."
