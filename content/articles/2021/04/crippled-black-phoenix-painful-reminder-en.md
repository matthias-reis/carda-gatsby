**Crippled Black Phoenix have just released their new single "Painful Reminder". It is a cover version of the SNFU song. It is their first recording with their new singer and lyricist Joel Segerstedt.**

The song is part of the 2-song EP "Painful Reminder/Dead Is Dead", which will be released on July 16 at Season of Mist. We can be curious: The realisation of the first song is very promising. The soulful vocals get under your skin, and musically the track is once again a precious Crippled Black Phoenix gem.

### Crippled Black Phoenix introduce a new singer

Joel's voice contrasts with Belinda's singing. The result is a pleasant dynamic. Here is a statement Crippled Black Phoenix made about it:

> "The first thing we're doing after 'Ellengæst' is a special single. It is a cover version of the classic SNFU song 'Painful Reminder.' And it features our new vocalist/lyricist Joel Segerstedt. He joins the band to be the contrast to Belinda Kordic. This female/male dynamic is now an integral part of the CBP sound. After hearing his vocal talent in his other band, The Open Up And Bleeds, we knew Joel could be the missing piece of the jigsaw.
>
> This release is a way of introducing Joel to our crowd while at the same time paying tribute to Mr. Chi Pig. The song was already on our shortlist of cover song ideas. Now was the time to do it because of the sad passing of Chi Pig in 2020. It seemed the right thing to pay our respects to a talented and underrated singer/lyricist and unique character in the punk rock world."

### "We wanted to pay our respects to Mr Chi Pig"

The lead singer of Canadian hardcore-punk band SNFU Ken Chinn aka Mr. Chi Pig, died on July 16 2020, after a long illness. Well known for his eccentricity, he was the most important member of the band. In March 2018, they announced a health-related hiatus.

They had initially announced tour dates for 2018 but later cancelled them. In November, Chinn announced that he had been diagnosed with a serious medical condition that would soon become fatal.

Already ill, he recorded his 7" solo single: an orchestral version of the Nine Inch Nails song "Hurt" (also covered by Johnny Cash). After that, he recorded the single "Painful Reminder", which mentioned here. Chinn was 57 years old. A total of 31 musicians had been part of SNFU since its formation in 1981. Chinn was the only one who had been there from the beginning. Shortly after his death, the band released the acoustic track "Cement Mixer" on YouTube. It is his last known recording.
