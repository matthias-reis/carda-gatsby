**Do you remember my interview with Lightning Sharks? You know, these noise core guys who would love to scream in Bolsonaro's face. Now the Bristol band has finished their debut EP. I have listened to it. Here is my recommendation for you.**

<blockquote>

"Life Is A Hideous Thing", and from the background behind what we know of it peer demoniacal hints of truth which make it sometimes a thousandfold more hideous. Science, already oppressive with its shocking revelations, will perhaps be the ultimate exterminator of our human species—if separate species we are its reserve of unguessed horrors could never be borne by mortal brains if loosed upon the world."

H.P. Lovecraft, "The Transition of H. P. Lovecraft: The Road to Madness"

</blockquote>

The EP consists of three smokin' hot pieces that 2021 definitely lacked off. The band will release it on Halfmeltetbrainrecords tomorrow April, 2nd.

## Lightning Sharks deliver blast beats and weird guitars

When bassist Sam texted me that the record was ready, I was very excited. I wanted to know what was behind the title "Life Is A Hideous Thing" right away. I had to wait three days until the tracks were ready for listening and up in the cloud. All I can say is: I am the opposite of disappointed! The record is really cool.

I'm incredibly looking forward to hopefully hearing it played live at [ArcTanGent](/2019/09/arctangent-festival-2019-2/) Festival this year. I know it's a bit shaky with festivals these days, but it just HAS to work out!

The debut EP of the band from southwest England pretty much hits the spot. Heavy blast beats, weird guitars and powerful vocals show what the hard and dark side of post-everything music looks like: hard, dark and: brilliant. By the way, Lightning Sharks don't refrain from being melodic at times.

## #1 "Below The Snakes"

A total of three songs are putting you in the mood and, above all, make you want more. Track 1 "Below The Snakes", tells of the authorities who steer us for their pathetic greed; about the distrust of the jurisdiction, the virtue of indecision and the painful realisation that we ourselves are the biggest threat. Just as in Lovecraft writings.

Raw and crude and melodic and considered at once: This song is the perfect opener for a new festival summer. A wailing guitar, crazy tempo and beautiful Bixler-Zavala hints. Great!

## #2 "Nomads"

Driving sound and pleasantly disturbing screaming: I like it. This piece of music expresses just what its lyrics are telling.

"Nomads" is about the feeling of being out of place and feeling that it's too late to turn back. The song brings up questions: Are we strong enough to handle the world's frightening and sorrows? Do we manage to find our way and face the fear? The song stirs me up, spins me around and makes me land with my feet on the ground. In the mud in front of the ArcTanGent tent stage. With a mug of cider in my hand and one in my hair. The insane tempo pulls me right into the mosh pit. The tune beats the screaming injustice of the world out of your cochleas.

## #3 Best Dressed Sex Pest

"Best Dressed Sex Pest" begins more quietly than its two predecessors. Lightning Sharks strike pensive notes, only to get going again in the next bar. The song is about power, abuse, contempt and corruption. Rixon's raw lyrics blow me away once again.

The confused guitars are circling the band like a swarm of hornets and lift the sound onto a stable pedestal that drives on the rhythm section. Topsy-turvy world? Not on this record! Everything sits precisely where it's supposed to – no unwanted buzzing here and clanking there. Even over hi-fi headphones, the thing sounds round.

With "Life Is A Hideous Thing" Lightning Sharks have delivered. I am pleased about this energetic and exciting debut and look forward to much more from this band. And I like the Lovecraft quote, though! I hope to see the Sharks live on stage pretty soon! PLEASE!
