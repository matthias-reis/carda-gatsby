**Vægtløs is a band for lovers of emotion-driven heavy post-music. I listened to their debut 7", "Kakofoni," and here is my recommendation: Fans of Birds in Row, Lightbearer, Deafheaven, Oathbreaker, Pianos Become the Teeth, Svalbard, Touchè Amorè, and Vi som älskade varandra så mycket should definitely give it a listen!**

The post-metal/post-hardcore/blackgaze project from Denmark released their first official recording on November 3rd (OK, not really their first official recording, they did a split EP with Mill & TaagebueMaybe earlier this year). I'm maybe a bit late to the party, but this truly fantastic piece of music is still worth mentioning!

The band recorded all the lyrics on the 15:25 min record in Danish. The language underlines the overall mystic character of the two songs—or should I say compositions? I think "songs" is a bit too much understatement for what awaits you on this wonderful debut.

## "Kakofoni" doesn't fit into boxes

![Vægtløs](https://storage.googleapis.com/cardamonchai-media/2022-12-01/vagtlos-2-jpg-imagine-280808_440309_1024_768/640.webp "Vægtløs")

I like the overall mood of "Kakofoni"—all the screaming, ups and downs, and contrasts: Really great post-music. The drums are quite heavy, underlining the dark-sounding lyrics in a very enthusiastic way. The whole rhythmic section builds a strong backbone of the partwise, wonderfully fragile sound. I think, besides the lyrics that tell the story about the loss of two people who were very close friends of the band, this is why my first impression of the two tracks was really tensive, and emotional.

So, if you like heavy, thoughtful, emotion-driven post-whatever, this is for you! Pretty hardcore, but length-wise, more like proggy post-metal. Wah, I don't like boxes. Maybe I should just leave them behind. Vægtløs blew them up anyway.

The band says the record is very personal for them: 

> "'Kakofini' is about the dialogue of death and how to handle it. It is a dialogue the band wants to open with this record."

"Kakofoni" is available in four different vinyl colours, on tape, and—of course—you can also download your digital version.

Some days ago, Vægtløs released the video for their single "Når de ord, vi har brug for skyder op af sig selv, får vi en ny sang" ("When the words, we need, blossoms, we will learn a new song"). Please check it out here:
