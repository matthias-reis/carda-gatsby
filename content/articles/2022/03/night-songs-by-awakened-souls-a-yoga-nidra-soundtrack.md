**On March 18, awakened souls will release their new record, "Night Songs". It is the first solo awakened souls record since "How We Heal". awakened souls recorded it to help people sleep better in times of fear and confusion.**

In the spring of 2021, the duo realized that good night's sleep is more important than ever in times of pandemic – times when children have to be homeschooled, and the lines between work and leisure are becoming increasingly blurred.

awakened souls have always been on the lookout for music that calms the mind and helps you fall asleep. "Night Songs" is their version of a cosy evening album. They combined slowly evolving loop-based ambient sounds with bass and beautiful vocal textures with their work. Cynthia describes it this way:

> "The tracks that ultimately made it on Night Songs are the ones that made us relax enough to go to a place where thoughts fade."

I indeed couldn't have described the experience I had listening to "Night Songs" for the first time any more beautifully. Because that's precisely what the music of awakened souls does: it carries me away, gently beds me and slows down the carousel of thoughts in my head already with the first notes.

## "Night Songs" lets me gently drift off to sleep

Unlike other pieces from this genre, I don't find myself in an endless sound loop while listening. Instead, the music is constantly evolving. The total of six songs is the perfect start to an evening of rest, meditation and relaxation. With the harmonious sounds, I manage to slip quietly into relaxation mode after I've done my work, and then a few hours later, I'm able to drift off to sleep.

Because it has become a dear evening routine for me in recent months to listen to either a guided mediation or quiet ambient pieces through headphones after I have turned off the lights, "Night Songs" comes in very handy. I feel very comfortable with it and can imagine listening to the album regularly while falling asleep.

For me, "Night Songs" is the perfect soundtrack for my Yoga Nidra - the deeply relaxed state of clear consciousness that occurs just before falling asleep or during the relaxation phase after a yoga session.

"Night Songs" by awakened souls brings just that to all those who wish for a moment of peace in between in these tangled times – blissful relaxation that goes by ear, that spreads very slowly, little by little, over the whole body.

## A benefit compilation for Ukraine

Also, this Friday, the benefit compilation "For Ukraine" by Headphone Commute and Hollie + Keith Kenniff will be released, featuring Cynthia and James with their brand new song "Melt Away". This piece is definitely also worth a listen. Here are a few words about it from Headphone Commute:

> "The first two minutes of '7.83' (so named for the frequency of Earth's vibration) are a raw field recording of the shelling of Kyiv, sent to us by a listener who is in the very centre of the violence and uncertainty. The remainder of the piece is a howling breath surrounded by heaviness, our primary motivation being a deep admiration for those in Ukraine using everything they have — both literally and figuratively — to resist injustice and maintain sovereignty in the face of sadistic, autocratic forces."
