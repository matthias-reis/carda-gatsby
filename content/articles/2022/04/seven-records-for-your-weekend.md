**I selected seven records that I want to recommend to you to ensure you have a lovely weekend (and somehow also a bit for my personal benefit). I have listened across the genres and put together these gems by Nyos, Dälek, Nonsun, Druids, Advocaat, Egor Lappo, and Drum & Lace.**

At the moment, it's hardly possible for me to see through all the messages about new releases, so today, I just sat down to get an overview and answer at least a few emails. Seven exceptional new releases caught my eye (or should I say ear?).

## Nonsun - "Blood & Spirit" (Album: "That Witch Does Not Kill")

"Blood & Spirit" by doom/post-metal collective Nonsun from Lviv, Ukraine, will be released on April 15th on DUNK!records. The label will be donating 100 per cent of the profits for the album to the band from March 29th until the release day, and all earnings for their 2018 released record "Black Snow Desert" – So go and buy Nonsun's music!

If you're already familiar with "Black Snow Desert", "Blood & Spirit" will probably blow your mind. You are right: The first record was already a masterpiece, but the new one is quite a development!  

Blood & Spirit doesn't follow a clear concept – the album is more like a collection of independent songs: Every track tells its own story. In addition, Nonsun added a breathtaking doomy touch to their previously cultivated post-metal style – This is precisely how an extraordinary record is made. I don't know for sure, but maybe this is going to be your album of the month. In any case, I hope you enjoy listening to it. The band chose "Blood & Spirit" to be the pre-release of the record. I think it's a good choice.

## Nyos - "Light" (Album: "Celebration")

Nyos from Finland are now part of Pelagic Records. I recently introduced them to you [here](/2021/08/nyos-nature-en/). Today they are celebrating the release of their new album. Here is the band's statement on the pre-released single "Light":

> "Light is a song we'd talked about making for a little while, an idea from Tuomas where the main guitar loop would be the glue/percussive element and his drums could float around like a big fast fill for the whole song! It is a track we actually have only recently started playing live together in person (in preparation for the Celebration Release Tour). It was recorded straight from only the idea and built up in the studio the way it is. For us, it was a whole new way of doing things. We hope you enjoy the result!"

I definitely do. What about you guys?

## Druids - Ide's Koan (Album: "Shadow Work")

Druids have announced their new album "Shadow Work" for June 3rd. A first taste is already available with "Ide's Koan". This band is also signed to Pelagic but plays an entirely different tune. The trio from Iowa has been on the road for over 13 years. Their wonderfully twisted mix of sludge and psychedelic never gets boring. "Shadow Work" is their fourth full-length recording. Its clear focus on various vocal types differs it from its predecessors. Here is how drummer Keith Rich describes it:

> "We wanted to make a record that reflected the uncertainty of everything in 2020, and we figured this would be the time to really try something different,"

You better give it a listen!

## Big Eleanor Records Advocaat - "Dark Patterns"

Advocaat is your new favourite indie punk duo from Southeastern Pennsylvania – consisting of Kyle Patrick Caffrey and Danny Nono. They recorded their latest project, "Dark Patterns", at Kaleidoscope, Lancaster. 

The three describe the record as a 6-song cycle of negative behaviours. I can immediately guess what they mean by that when listening to it. All six pieces are wonderfully clear and direct – just what today's world desperately needs. I definitely want more of this wonderfully nonchalant punk attitude soon. But luckily there is Advocaat. You can find their EP on all music streaming platforms.

## Dälek feat. Adam Jones (Tool) - "A Heretic's Inheritance"

My brother recommended this record to me. I think it's excellent, and I have to admit that I haven't really looked into this project yet. I should probably catch up on it. The industrial rap duo Dälek (Mike Manteca and Joshua Booth aka MC Dälek) signed with Mike Patton's label Ipecac. They recorded their latest album with none other than Tool guitarist and visual arts genius Adam Jones. You can hear him in the new single "A Heretic's Inheritance". Since Dälek opened the stage for his band on tour in 2010, they have stayed in touch. Here is what Adam told the press:

> "Working together was something we'd thrown around in the past, so when Will came to me with 'A Heretic's Inheritance', I instantly said yes and began sharing ideas with him within a couple of days."

It seems worth the work because the result is really worth listening to. The complete album is announced for April 29th.

## Egor Lappo (feat. Francisco Meza) - "Dawn Tracer" from the album "Naturealism".

I introduced Egor Lappo to you [last year](/2021/02/egor-lappo-trancevoicer-en/). Today he released his new album "Naturealism". The current situation is tough for him, which you can also hear in his music. The record is about phobias, fear and loss of control. I had the chance to ask him some questions about the ten songs and the stories behind them. The track "Invisible Walls" is about the fear of losing control over what happens. With "Unreal", the musician expresses the feeling of derealisation. "Crepuscular" is about how he enjoys quiet walks late at night in places where he can be all by himself. The song is meant to be an escape from reality and bad thoughts. With "Dawn Tracer", he expresses the fear that something terrible might happen soon, making the present unenjoyable as one spends time waiting for the inevitable. I want to share the track "Dawn Tracer" with you, on which Egor has brought in support from Francisco Meza. The whole record is absolutely worth listening to. So 
give it a try.

## Drum & Lace - "Armanatura" (Album: "Natura")

Another brand new release from today is this beautiful piece of ambient. Kévin Sery from Past Inside the Present shared it with me the other day. Drum & Lace aka Sofia degli Alessandri-Hultquist is an Italian composer, sound artist and performer. She writes and creates music for film and media. With "Natura", she delivers her debut on Past Inside the Present. It is also her first full-length album. For Sofia, the record is a homage to intelligent electronica sound. And one thing is for sure: Lovers of good ambient music will love these ten outstanding pieces. So I decided to share the second track on the record with you. "Armanatura" was the last pre-release before today's big release. It seems like the perfect start to dive into Drum & Laces' music.
