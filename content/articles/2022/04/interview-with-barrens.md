**Barrens have just finished their postponed tour with God Is An Astronaut. The post-rock band from Sweden is currently working on a new album. Their previous record, "Penumbra", which they released on Pelagic Records, was very well received live. I now had the chance to meet them for an interview.**

**Anne:** Hi! How are you doing today? Thanks for taking the time for this interview!

**Barrens:** Hello! We're great, thank you! At the moment, we are in our van on our way to Wiesbaden to play at Schlachthof tonight with God Is An Astronaut. We woke up at a beautiful location right outside Utrecht after playing a sold-out show at De Helling last night, also with GIAA, so life is pretty good at the moment.

**Anne:** How is the tour with God Is An Astronaut going so far? How are you guys getting along?

## "Touring with God Is An Astronaut is amazing"

**Barrens:** Yes, we're doing our seventh and last show for the spring part of our tour with them tonight, and so far, it has been excellent. We've been very well taken care of, and the guys in GIAA and their crew are an absolute treat to work with. We couldn't ask for better tour partners.

**Anne:** How does it feel to play in a big venue with lots of people after two years without touring due to the worldwide pandemic situation?

**Barrens:** It feels fantastic to be able to bring this music on the road finally. When we finished Penumbra and released it, we were all set to hit the road and play as much as we could, and then the pandemic happened, and everything ground to a halt. This tour was supposed to be a tour of five weeks, and it got pushed forward and changed around so many times that we were almost despairing and doubting that it would even happen at all. But now we're here, it's not as many shows as it was supposed to be at first, but we're making the most of the ones we're still able to play and are enjoying ourselves immensely. The audience's response has been excellent, and even though we're the opening act, there has been a terrific sized crowd before we've even hit the stage at all the shows. Many people came up to us saying they're at the show as much for our sake and GIAA. And, of course, many new fans! It's been overwhelming and amazing.

## "We love being on sage"

**Anne:** I've heard some rumours that you are also working on some new music. Are they true? We all loved your 2020 album "Penumbra", and we are more than curious! So what's up next from Barrens?

**Barrens:** We're playing two new songs on this tour, "road testing" them, you could call it. That album was an experiment since we wrote and recorded Penumbra without playing any shows. It's been fun to finally bring these tracks to the stage and find out what their "live"-personalities are. Some of the songs from Penumbra have changed a bit, and some have worked as written/recorded. Figuring all of this stuff out has been fun, and it also serves as a guiding light to help us navigate writing new material. We love playing live and want the new material to translate the energy and vibe we have at shows and be a logical next step from Penumbra, so these shows are essential for us to develop.

**Anne:** With your songs, you combine the very dark face of post-music with its lighter side. How did you come up with that? It quite well mirrors the overall mood, especially of the last few years. Or would you say it's how life is in general?

## A hopeful light

**Barrens:** There never was a master plan sound-wise for us, except for a few things. We wanted to use synthesizers, we enjoyed the instrumental music, and we wanted to see what we could do as a trio. Mood-wise, we were all going through some transformative phase in our lives, and the concept of metamorphosis/change/navigating through blinding light/darkness came naturally. That is, of course, influenced partly by the zeitgeist but also led into the following years in many ways. There can be no darkness without light and vice versa, which is a fundamental truth. We are going through dark times, but there are varying degrees/shades of night and a hopeful light shining. 

After more than 20 to 25 years of playing music in various bands, we are more or less the same kind of people. We play music because we need to because we must. We don't make any money from doing this. We're coming home a lot poorer than when we left, but that's how it is. If/when the day comes when it's not feasible for us to do it anymore, we'll have to decide what to do then. But for now, it's ok. We're lucky enough to have understanding partners and families that support what we do and jobs where we can take time off to play, and that is fundamental for us when the situation is what it is. There's nothing like a free lunch for a band in our position. It's dedication, hard work, sacrifice, and fingers crossed that everything works out for the best. That reflects in the music we write.

**Anne:** What puts you in the mood to work on new music? Is there something that you would describe as your infinite well of inspiration?

## "You need to use the inspiration once it is there"

**Barrens:**  Inspiration is a fleeting thing, it's a rare bird that seldom lands on your lawn, and you'd better have your camera ready. The rest of the time, it's hard work that is needed – hours upon hours of dwelling on each note, each drum hit. Of course, there are times when a train of thought is easier to follow from start to end, but that is sometimes very difficult. We live in different cities and don't have the opportunity to see each other several times a week to rehearse, to work in that traditional way, so we need to work differently. 

We have a lot of demos, riffs, and ideas that we piece together and test out when we see each other. Sometimes it flows, but it often doesn't, but that's what it is all about. We discuss concepts and images that we would like to convey and see what we can make of them. Although, ugh, this is not a very interesting answer. I guess this is what all bands do. 

**Anne:** Some bands tell me they strictly differentiate between their music and politics, and some use their music as their political voice. If there were a scale to picture this: Where would you place yourself?

**Barrens:** Barrens as a concept is not about making political statements, but at the same time, in one way or another, everything in life is political. To make music and art can therefore be seen as a reflection of the society. It's a product of its own time. 

## "With Barrens our ideas finally found a home"

**Anne:** You founded as a trio in 2018. Two of you came from the Malmö band Scraps Of Tape. Would you describe Barrens as the continuation of SOT, or is it a completely new project?

**Barrens:**No, Barrens is not a continuation of Scraps Of Tape. Barrens is a new thing, but specific ideas and styles do not work in S.o.T have found a home. 

When starting Barrens (mentioned earlier), we had specific ideas that we wanted to explore. Unfortunately, scraps Of Tape had to take a break for various reasons, so we used the downtime to explore these ideas and discover what Barrens could become. 

**Anne:** Johan, this question is for you: We got to know each other over social media during the lockdown period in 2020. [I also interviewed you about your solo project last year](/2021/03/johan-g-winther-interview-en/). You have your hands in many projects, such as Blessings and Barrens, and you also released seven albums with Scraps of Tape. I can imagine this quite intense. Are there times when you are not working in a studio, writing music or are on tour with one of your bands? How do you manage to be part of all these fabulous projects?

## "We have very understanding partners"

**Barrens:**  Yes, thank you so much for your interest in what I do. I appreciate it!

Music is not my full-time job. I'm a teacher, and all of this music stuff has to happen "on the side". I also have a family and am a father with growing kids, just like the other members of Barrens. When you put all the projects I'm involved in side by side, it looks like a lot, but as with everything in life, things work in cycles. It's not too often that all bands are active 100 per cent simultaneously, and it's usually pretty easy to keep things flowing. Admittedly, it can become too much at times, but it usually works out. I play with understanding people and have a very understanding partner. But it gets more challenging as you get older, I have to admit that. It's not as easy to just up and leave for a tour as it once was. You have responsibilities, your kids need you, and your body isn't as strong as it once was, but I try to stay as busy as I can for as long as it works.

**Anne:** Do you have a ritual before going on stage?

**Barrens:** No, not really. We are very serious with what we do, and our focus at concerts is to perform as well as possible, have as much fun as we can, and connect with the audience, so we don't drink before we go on stage. We make sure things are working well and give ourselves the best conditions to make each show as good as possible. We also want to be respectful to the people who work hard at all the venues and on stage. They're as much a part of making each show a positive experience as we are. We're all part of the same team on a concert night, and you need to be respectful.

**Anne:** Thanks very much for answering my questions! All the best for your tour and album plans! Please stay safe and take care!

**Barrens:**  Thank you so much for your interest and well wishes. Stay safe, and I hope to talk again sometime.
