seoTitle: Dream Vision Founder Jan – Post-Rock Interview
description: Dream Vision founder Jan just released his debut album. After
  starting his solo project in December, he had already released some songs in
  January. Time for an interview.
excerpt: Jan, who you might know as one of the founding members of the
  atmospheric post-metal project Zorya from Slovenia, started his new solo
  project Dream Vision last December. His freshly released debut, "Rêves", is a
  dreamful mix of electronic blackgaze and post-rock music with influences in
  the post-black and depressive black metal genre. I now had the chance to talk
  to the multi-instrumentalist who recorded the whole album all by himself.

**Jan, who you might know as one of the founding members of the atmospheric post-metal project Zorya from Slovenia, started his new solo project Dream Vision last December. His freshly released debut, "Rêves", is a dreamful mix of electronic blackgaze and post-rock music with influences in the post-black and depressive black metal genre. I now had the chance to talk to the multi-instrumentalist who recorded the whole album all by himself.**

Anne: Hey! Thanks for taking the time for this interview! How are you doing at the moment? Congrats on your brand-new album, "Rêves"! It's wonderful!

Jan: Hey! Thanks so much for your words. I am a little exhausted right now, but I am happy because all the hard work I did for the album seems to pay off.

Anne: Do you want to tell me the story behind it? Does it tell one? "Rêves" is French for dreaming. So I guess it's related to your band name?

## "I started mixing blackgaze and darkwave metal with elements of post-rock"

![Dream Vision – "Rêves"](https://storage.googleapis.com/cardamonchai-media/2022-05-30/dream-vision-reve-png-imagine-081818_12252f_3000_3000/640.webp "Dream Vision – \"Rêves\"")

Jan: No, it doesn't tell one. I searched for a band name, but I didn't know what would be good for my listeners and me. So, I checked countless websites about psychology and finally found these words. 

"Dream Vision" has many meanings in psychology. I don't know why I am such a fan of psychology, but if you play metal music, you have at least a 30 per cent chance that your theme is depression or psychology. And yes, you are right: The name of the record is tied to the band name. So, both words have connections in psychology. And I thought "Rêves" would be the perfect fit.

Anne: Your music is not only dark and sad but also kind of dreamy. Have you always been into this electronic blackgaze/dreamgaze/post-metal ambient kind of style? It seems like you feel pretty at home with it, which is wonderful.

Jan: Oh no. When I was a kid, I was a fan of metal and rock music. But, when I started to like black metal a few years ago, I searched for some fresh and new music, so I found post-rock and relative genres. I am making post-black music with my first band, Zorya, but here I wanted to do something new, not discovered so well. So, I started mixing blackgaze and darkwave metal music with elements of post-rock and more complex genres.

Anne: Do you have a favourite song on the record?

Jan: This is also a tricky question, hah. I think I don't have to because I like all the songs, but everything can always be better. So, I would say I don't have a favourite song right now.

Anne: Who would you say are your three biggest influences?

Jan: Alcest, Abstract Void, and Dance with the Dead.

Anne: You are from Slovenia – I've always wanted to travel there. Any recommendations for my Slovenia trip? 

Sorry, I got carried away. What I wanted to ask is: how would you describe the Slovenian music scene? I can imagine it being quite creative and inspiring. Is it?

## "I started Dream Vision in December and released the first music in January"

Jan: Oh, come here. I can give you some trip advice. You know, Slovenia is small. You can drive the whole country in a few hours, but you have many natural destinations and lovely old castles. I would say that the music scene in Slovenia is much better than it was, but we are a small country, so the problem is that there are not so many people who listen to that kind of music.

Anne: When did you start Dream Vision?

Jan: I started Dream Vision in December last year and released my first songs this January.

Anne: You already mentioned Zorya, which is your other project. Did you play in other bands before you started the project?

January: Some years ago, I was in a pop-rock band with my brothers.

Anne: The whole genre of post-metal/blackgaze etc., is quite dark, and the music tends in some kind of sad and thoughtful direction – which I admire a lot. What do you think? Why is it that we love a good dark and heavy record? And that, on the other hand, some people would call this music depressive? Do you think it has the power to lighten up our overall mood? What differentiates us from people who love all this happy dancehall music?

## "People have the wrong idea of music"

Jan: I think this is because we have a wrong idea about music in our minds. I make this kind of music, and I don't feel depressed. I try to make appropriate effects with music, so if you listen to this music, you will be happy, but if you are happy, you can be sad. It's an emotional exposure. I think we are different: We have the courage to talk about taboo things.

Anne: What's up next for Dream Vision? Are you already writing new songs? Any tour plans?

Jan: First, I will release an EP for my first project, Zorya. Later I will start making new music. After that, I probably won't have tours because I don't particularly appreciate playing live so much.
